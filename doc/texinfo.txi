@c Ordinarily, Texinfo files have the extension .texi.  But texinfo.texi
@c clashes with texinfo.tex on 8.3 filesystems, so we use texinfo.txi.

@c Everything between the start/end of header lines will be passed by
@c Emacs's {texinfo,makeinfo}-format region commands.  See the `start of
@c header' node for more info.
@c %**start of header

@c makeinfo and texinfo.tex ignore all text before @setfilename.
@c
@c Ordinarily, the setfilename argument ends with .info.  But
@c texinfo.info-13 is too long for 14-character filesystems.
@setfilename texinfo

@c Automake automatically updates version.texi to @set VERSION and
@c @set UPDATED to appropriate values.
@include version.texi
@settitle GNU Texinfo @value{VERSION}

@c Define a new index for options.
@defcodeindex op
@c Put everything except function (command, in this case) names in one
@c index (arbitrarily chosen to be the concept index).

GNU Texinfo is @dfn{free software}; this means that everyone is free
to use it and free to redistribute it on certain conditions.  Texinfo
is not in the public domain; it is copyrighted and there are
restrictions on its distribution, but these restrictions are designed
to permit everything that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.
What is not allowed is to try to prevent others from further sharing
any version of Texinfo that they might get from you.

Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away
copies of the programs that relate to Texinfo, that you receive source
code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change these
programs or use pieces of them in new free programs, and that you know
you can do these things.

To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of the Texinfo related programs, you must give the recipients all
the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or
can get the source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds
out that there is no warranty for the programs that relate to Texinfo.
If these programs are modified by someone else and passed on, we want
their recipients to know that what they have is not what we distributed,
so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on our
reputation.

The precise conditions of the licenses for the programs currently being
distributed that relate to Texinfo are found in the General Public

@dfn{Texinfo}@footnote{The first syllable of ``Texinfo'' is pronounced
like ``speck'', not ``hex''.  This odd pronunciation is derived from,
but is not the same as, the pronunciation of @TeX{}.  In the word
@TeX{}, the @samp{X} is actually the Greek letter ``chi'' rather than
the English letter ``ex''.  Pronounce @TeX{} as if the @samp{X} were the
last sound in the name `Bach'; but pronounce Texinfo as if the @samp{x}
were a `k'.  Spell ``Texinfo'' with a capital ``T'' and the other
letters in lower case.}  is a documentation system that uses a single
source file to produce both online information and printed output.  This
means that instead of writing two different documents, one for the
online information and the other for a printed work, you need write only
one document.  Therefore, when the work is revised, you need revise only
that one document.

Manuals for most GNU packages are written in Texinfo, and available
online at @url{http://www.gnu.org/doc}.

@node Using Texinfo
@section Using Texinfo

@cindex Using Texinfo in general
@cindex Texinfo, introduction to
@cindex Introduction to Texinfo

Using Texinfo, you can create a printed document (via the @TeX{}
typesetting system) the normal features of a book, including chapters,
sections, cross references, and indices.  From the same Texinfo source
file, you can create an Info file with special features to make
documentation browsing easy.  You can also create from that same
source file an HTML output file suitable for use with a web browser,
or an XML file.  See the next section (@pxref{Output Formats}) for
details and the exact commands to generate output from the source.

@TeX{} works with virtually all printers; Info works with virtually all
computer terminals; the HTML output works with virtually all web
browsers.  Thus Texinfo can be used by almost any computer user.

@cindex Source file format
A Texinfo source file is a plain ASCII file containing text
interspersed with @dfn{@@-commands} (words preceded by an @samp{@@})
that tell the typesetting and formatting programs what to do.  You can
edit a Texinfo file with any text editor, but it is especially
convenient to use GNU Emacs since that editor has a special mode,
called Texinfo mode, that provides various Texinfo-related features.
(@xref{Texinfo Mode}.)

You can use Texinfo to create both online help and printed manuals;
moreover, Texinfo is freely redistributable.  For these reasons, Texinfo
is the official documentation format of the GNU project.  More
information is available at the @uref{http://www.gnu.org/doc/, GNU
documentation web page}.


@node Output Formats
@section Output Formats
@cindex Output formats
@cindex Back-end output formats

Here is a brief overview of the output formats currently supported by
Texinfo.

@table @asis
@item Info
@cindex Info output
(Generated via @command{makeinfo}.)  This format is essentially a
plain text transliteration of the Texinfo source.  It adds a few
control characters to separate nodes and provide navigational
information for menus, cross-references, indices, and so on.  See the
next section (@pxref{Info Files}) for more details on this format.
The Emacs Info subsystem (@pxref{Top,,Getting Started,info, Info}),
and the standalone @command{info} program (@pxref{Top
,, Info Standalone, info-stnd, GNU Info}), among others, can read these
files.  @xref{Creating and Installing Info Files}.

@item Plain text
@cindex Plain text output
(Generated via @command{makeinfo --plaintext}.)  This is almost the
same as Info output, except the navigational control characters are
omitted.  Also, standard output is used by default.

@item HTML
@cindex HTML output
@cindex W3 consortium
@cindex Mozilla
@cindex Lynx
@cindex Emacs-W3
(Generated via @command{makeinfo --html}.)  This is the Hyper Text
Markup Language that has become the most commonly used language for
writing documents on the World Wide Web.  Web browsers, such as
Mozilla, Lynx, and Emacs-W3, can render this language online.  There
are many versions of HTML; @command{makeinfo} tries to use a subset
of the language that can be interpreted by any common browser.  For
details of the HTML language and much related information, see
@uref{http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/}.  @xref{Generating HTML}.

@item DVI
@cindex DVI output
@pindex dvips
@pindex xdvi
(Generated via @command{texi2dvi}.)  This DeVice Independent binary
format is output by the @TeX{} typesetting program
(@uref{http://tug.org}).  This is then read by a DVI `driver', which
writes the actual device-specific commands that can be viewed or
printed, notably Dvips for translation to PostScript (@pxref{Invoking
Dvips,,, dvips, Dvips}) and Xdvi for viewing on an X display
(@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/xdvi/}).  @xref{Hardcopy}.

Be aware that the Texinfo language is very different from and much
stricter than @TeX{}'s usual languages, plain @TeX{} and @LaTeX{}.
For more information on @TeX{} in general, please see the book
@cite{@TeX{} for the Impatient}, available from
@uref{http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/teximpatient}.

@item PDF
@cindex PDF output
@cindex Beebe, Nelson
@pindex pdftex
(Generated via @command{texi2dvi --pdf} or @command{texi2pdf}.)  This
format was developed by Adobe Systems for portable document
interchange, based on their previous PostScript language.  It can
represent the exact appearance of a document, including fonts and
graphics, and supporting arbitrary scaling.  It is intended to be
platform-independent and easily viewable, among other design goals;
@uref{http://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb22-3/tb72beebe-pdf.pdf} has
some background.  Texinfo uses the @command{pdftex} program, a variant
of @TeX{}, to output PDF; see
@uref{http://tug.org/applications/pdftex}.  @xref{PDF Output}.

@item XML
@cindex XML output
@cindex DTD, for Texinfo XML
@pindex texinfo.dtd
(Generated via @command{makeinfo --xml}.)  XML is a generic syntax
specification usable for any sort of content (see, for example,
@uref{http://www.w3.org/XML/}).  The @command{makeinfo} XML output,
unlike all the formats above, interprets very little of the Texinfo
source.  Rather, it merely translates the Texinfo markup commands into
XML syntax, for processing by further XML tools.  The particular
syntax output is defined in the file @file{texinfo.dtd} included in
the Texinfo source distribution.

@item Docbook
@cindex Docbook output
(Generated via @command{makeinfo --docbook}.)  This is an XML-based
format developed some years ago, primarily for technical
documentation.  It therefore bears some resemblance, in broad
outlines, to Texinfo.  See @uref{http://www.docbook.org}.  If you want
to convert from Docbook @emph{to} Texinfo, please see
@uref{http://docbook2X.sourceforge.net}.

@end table

@cindex Man page output, not supported
From time to time, proposals are made to generate traditional Unix man
pages from Texinfo source.  However, because man pages have a very
strict conventional format, generating a good man page requires a
completely different source than the typical Texinfo applications of
writing a good user tutorial and/or a good reference manual.  This
makes generating man pages incompatible with the Texinfo design goal
of not having to document the same information in different ways for
different output formats.  You might as well just write the man page
directly.

@pindex help2man
@cindex O'Dea, Brendan
Man pages still have their place, and if you wish to support them, you
may find the program @command{help2man} to be useful; it generates a
traditional man page from the @samp{--help} output of a program.  In
fact, this is currently used to generate man pages for the programs in
the Texinfo distribution.  It is GNU software written by Brendan
O'Dea, available from @uref{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/help2man/}.

@cindex Output formats, supporting more
@cindex SGML-tools output format
If you are a programmer and would like to contribute to the GNU project
by implementing additional output formats for Texinfo, that would be
excellent.  But please do not write a separate translator texi2foo for
your favorite format foo!  That is the hard way to do the job, and makes
extra work in subsequent maintenance, since the Texinfo language is
continually being enhanced and updated.  Instead, the best approach is
modify @code{makeinfo} to generate the new format.

An Info file is a Texinfo file formatted so that the Info documentation
reading program can operate on it.  (@code{makeinfo}
and @code{texinfo-format-buffer} are two commands that convert a Texinfo file
into an Info file.)

Info files are divided into pieces called @dfn{nodes}, each of which
contains the discussion of one topic.  Each node has a name, and
contains both text for the user to read and pointers to other nodes,
which are identified by their names.  The Info program displays one node
at a time, and provides commands with which the user can move to other
related nodes.

@xref{Top,,, info, GNU Info}, for more information about using Info.

Each node of an Info file may have any number of child nodes that
describe subtopics of the node's topic.  The names of child
nodes are listed in a @dfn{menu} within the parent node; this
allows you to use certain Info commands to move to one of the child
nodes.  Generally, an Info file is organized like a book.  If a node
is at the logical level of a chapter, its child nodes are at the level
of sections; likewise, the child nodes of sections are at the level
of subsections.

All the children of any one parent are linked together in a
bidirectional chain of `Next' and `Previous' pointers.  The `Next'
pointer provides a link to the next section, and the `Previous' pointer
provides a link to the previous section.  This means that all the nodes
that are at the level of sections within a chapter are linked together.
Normally the order in this chain is the same as the order of the
children in the parent's menu.  Each child node records the parent node
name as its `Up' pointer.  The last child has no `Next' pointer, and the
first child has the parent both as its `Previous' and as its `Up'
pointer.@footnote{In some documents, the first child has no `Previous'
pointer.  Occasionally, the last child has the node name of the next
following higher level node as its `Next' pointer.}

The book-like structuring of an Info file into nodes that correspond
to chapters, sections, and the like is a matter of convention, not a
requirement.  The `Up', `Previous', and `Next' pointers of a node can
point to any other nodes, and a menu can contain any other nodes.
Thus, the node structure can be any directed graph.  But it is usually
more comprehensible to follow a structure that corresponds to the
structure of chapters and sections in a printed book or report.@refill

In addition to menus and to `Next', `Previous', and `Up' pointers, Info
provides pointers of another kind, called references, that can be
sprinkled throughout the text.  This is usually the best way to
represent links that do not fit a hierarchical structure.@refill

Usually, you will design a document so that its nodes match the
structure of chapters and sections in the printed output.  But
occasionally there are times when this is not right for the material
being discussed.  Therefore, Texinfo uses separate commands to specify
the node structure for the Info file and the section structure for the
printed output.@refill

Generally, you enter an Info file through a node that by convention is
named `Top'.  This node normally contains just a brief summary of the
file's purpose, and a large menu through which the rest of the file is
reached.  From this node, you can either traverse the file
systematically by going from node to node, or you can go to a specific
node listed in the main menu, or you can search the index menus and then
go directly to the node that has the information you want.  Alternatively,
with the standalone Info program, you can specify specific menu items on
the command line (@pxref{Top,,, info, Info}).

If you want to read through an Info file in sequence, as if it were a
printed manual, you can hit @key{SPC} repeatedly, or you get the whole
file with the advanced Info command @kbd{g *}.  (@inforef{Advanced,
Advanced Info commands, info}.)@refill

@c !!! dir file may be located in one of many places:
@c     /usr/local/emacs/info            mentioned in info.c DEFAULT_INFOPATH
@c     /usr/local/lib/emacs/info        mentioned in info.c DEFAULT_INFOPATH
@c     /usr/gnu/info                    mentioned in info.c DEFAULT_INFOPATH
@c     /usr/local/info
@c     /usr/local/lib/info
The @file{dir} file in the @file{info} directory serves as the
departure point for the whole Info system.  From it, you can reach the
`Top' nodes of each of the documents in a complete Info system.@refill

@cindex URI syntax for Info
If you wish to refer to an Info file in a URI, you can use the
(unofficial) syntax exemplified in the following.  This works with
Emacs/W3, for example:
@example
info:///usr/info/emacs#Dissociated%20Press
info:emacs#Dissociated%20Press
info://localhost/usr/info/emacs#Dissociated%20Press
@end example

The @command{info} program itself does not follow URIs of any kind.

@cindex Characteristics, printed books or manuals

@cindex Knuth, Donald
A Texinfo file can be formatted and typeset as a printed book or manual.
To do this, you need @TeX{}, a powerful, sophisticated typesetting
program written by Donald Knuth.@footnote{You can also use the
@pindex texi2roff@r{, unsupported software}
@uref{ftp://tug.org/texi2roff.tar.gz, @code{texi2roff}} program if you
do not have @TeX{}; since Texinfo is designed for use with @TeX{},
@code{texi2roff} is not described here.  @code{texi2roff} is not part of
the standard GNU distribution and is not maintained or up-to-date with
all the Texinfo features described in this manual.}

A Texinfo-based book is similar to any other typeset, printed work: it
can have a title page, copyright page, table of contents, and preface,
as well as chapters, numbered or unnumbered sections and subsections,
page headers, cross references, footnotes, and indices.@refill

You can use Texinfo to write a book without ever having the intention
of converting it into online information.  You can use Texinfo for
writing a printed novel, and even to write a printed memo, although
this latter application is not recommended since electronic mail is so
much easier.@refill

@TeX{} is a general purpose typesetting program.  Texinfo provides a
file @file{texinfo.tex} that contains information (definitions or
@dfn{macros}) that @TeX{} uses when it typesets a Texinfo file.
(@file{texinfo.tex} tells @TeX{} how to convert the Texinfo @@-commands
to @TeX{} commands, which @TeX{} can then process to create the typeset
document.)  @file{texinfo.tex} contains the specifications for printing
a document.  You can get the latest version of @file{texinfo.tex} from
the Texinfo home page, @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/}.

In the United States, documents are most often printed on 8.5 inch by 11
inch pages (216@dmn{mm} by 280@dmn{mm}); this is the default size.  But
you can also print for 7 inch by 9.25 inch pages (178@dmn{mm} by
235@dmn{mm}, the @code{@@smallbook} size; or on A4 or A5 size paper
(@code{@@afourpaper}, @code{@@afivepaper}).  (@xref{smallbook, ,
Printing ``Small'' Books}.  Also, see @ref{A4 Paper, ,Printing on A4
Paper}.)

By changing the parameters in @file{texinfo.tex}, you can change the
size of the printed document.  In addition, you can change the style in
which the printed document is formatted; for example, you can change the
sizes and fonts used, the amount of indentation for each paragraph, the
degree to which words are hyphenated, and the like.  By changing the
specifications, you can make a book look dignified, old and serious, or
light-hearted, young and cheery.

@TeX{} is freely distributable.  It is written in a superset of Pascal
called WEB and can be compiled either in Pascal or (by using a
conversion program that comes with the @TeX{} distribution) in C.
(@xref{TeX Mode, ,@TeX{} Mode, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}, for information
about @TeX{}.)@refill

@TeX{} is very powerful and has a great many features.  Because a
Texinfo file must be able to present information both on a
character-only terminal in Info form and in a typeset book, the
formatting commands that Texinfo supports are necessarily limited.

To get a copy of @TeX{}, see
@ref{Obtaining TeX, , How to Obtain @TeX{}}.


@node Formatting Commands
@section @@-commands
@cindex @@-commands
@cindex Formatting commands

In a Texinfo file, the commands that tell @TeX{} how to typeset the
printed manual and tell @code{makeinfo} and
@code{texinfo-format-buffer} how to create an Info file are preceded
by @samp{@@}; they are called @dfn{@@-commands}.  For example,
@code{@@node} is the command to indicate a node and @code{@@chapter}
is the command to indicate the start of a chapter.@refill

@quotation Note
Almost all @@ command names are entirely lower case.
@end quotation

The Texinfo @@-commands are a strictly limited set of constructs.  The
strict limits make it possible for Texinfo files to be understood both
by @TeX{} and by the code that converts them into Info files.  You can
display Info files on any terminal that displays alphabetic and
numeric characters.  Similarly, you can print the output generated by
@TeX{} on a wide variety of printers.@refill

Depending on what they do or what arguments@footnote{The word
@dfn{argument} comes from the way it is used in mathematics and does not
refer to a dispute between two people; it refers to the information
presented to the command.  According to the @cite{Oxford English
Dictionary}, the word derives from the Latin for @dfn{to make clear,
prove}; thus it came to mean `the evidence offered as proof', which is
to say, `the information offered', which led to its mathematical
meaning.  In its other thread of derivation, the word came to mean `to
assert in a manner against which others may make counter assertions',
which led to the meaning of `argument' as a dispute.} they take, you
need to write @@-commands on lines of their own or as part of
sentences:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Write a command such as @code{@@quotation} at the beginning of a line as
the only text on the line.  (@code{@@quotation} begins an indented
environment.)

@item
Write a command such as @code{@@chapter} at the beginning of a line
followed by the command's arguments, in this case the chapter title, on
the rest of the line.  (@code{@@chapter} creates chapter titles.)@refill

@item
Write a command such as @code{@@dots@{@}} wherever you wish but usually
within a sentence. (@code{@@dots@{@}} creates an ellipsis @dots{})@refill

@item
Write a command such as @code{@@code@{@var{sample-code}@}} wherever you
wish (but usually within a sentence) with its argument,
@var{sample-code} in this example, between the braces.  (@code{@@code}
marks text as being code.)@refill

@item
Write a command such as @code{@@example} on a line of its own; write the
body-text on following lines; and write the matching @code{@@end}
command, @code{@@end example} in this case, on a line of its own
after the body-text. (@code{@@example} @dots{} @code{@@end example}
indents and typesets body-text as an example.)  It's usually ok to
indent environment commands like this, but in complicated and
hard-to-define circumstances the extra spaces cause extra space to
appear in the output, so beware.
@end itemize

@noindent
@cindex Braces, when to use
As a general rule, a command requires braces if it mingles among other
text; but it does not need braces if it starts a line of its own.  The
non-alphabetic commands, such as @code{@@:}, are exceptions to the rule;
they do not need braces.@refill

As you gain experience with Texinfo, you will rapidly learn how to
write the different commands: the different ways to write commands
actually make it easier to write and read Texinfo files than if all
commands followed exactly the same syntax.  @xref{Command Syntax, ,
@@-Command Syntax}, for all the details.


@node Conventions
@section General Syntactic Conventions
@cindex General syntactic conventions
@cindex Syntactic conventions
@cindex Conventions, syntactic
@cindex Characters, basic input

This section describes the general conventions used in all Texinfo documents.

@itemize @bullet
@item
@cindex Source files, characters used
All printable ASCII characters except @samp{@@}, @samp{@{} and
@samp{@}} can appear in a Texinfo file and stand for themselves.
@samp{@@} is the escape character which introduces commands, while
@samp{@{} and @samp{@}} are used to surround arguments to certain
commands.  To put one of these special characters into the document, put
an @samp{@@} character in front of it, like this: @samp{@@@@},
@samp{@@@{}, and @samp{@@@}}.

@item
@cindex Paragraph separator
@cindex Blank lines, as paragraph separator
@cindex Newlines, as blank lines
Separate paragraphs with one or more blank lines.  Currently Texinfo
only recognizes newline characters as end of line, not the CRLF
sequence used on some systems; so a @dfn{blank line} means exactly two
consecutive newlines.  Sometimes blank lines are useful or convenient
in other cases as well; you can use the @code{@@noindent} to inhibit
paragraph indentation if required (@pxref{noindent,,@code{@@noindent}}).

@item
Texinfo supports the usual quotation marks used in English, and
quotation marks used in other languages, please see @ref{Inserting
Quotation Marks}.

@item
@cindex Multiple dashes in source
@cindex Dashes in source
@cindex Hyphens in source, two or three in a row
@cindex Em dash, producing
@cindex En dash, producing
Use three hyphens in a row, @samp{---}, to produce a long dash---like
this (called an @dfn{em dash}), used for punctuation in sentences.
Use two hyphens, @samp{--}, to produce a medium dash (called an
@dfn{en dash}), used primarily for numeric ranges, as in ``June
25--26''.  Use a single hyphen, @samp{-}, to produce a standard hyphen
used in compound words.  For display on the screen, Info reduces three
hyphens to two and two hyphens to one (not transitively!).  Of course,
any number of hyphens in the source remain as they are in literal
contexts, such as @code{@@code} and @code{@@example}.

@item
@cindex Tabs; don't use!
@strong{Caution:} Last, do not use tab characters in a Texinfo file
(except in verbatim modes)!  @TeX{} uses variable-width fonts, which
means that it is impractical at best to define a tab to work in all
circumstances.  Consequently, @TeX{} treats tabs like single spaces,
and that is not what they look like in the source.  Furthermore,
@code{makeinfo} does nothing special with tabs, and thus a tab
character in your input file will usually appear differently in the
output.

@noindent
To avoid this problem, Texinfo mode in GNU Emacs inserts
multiple spaces when you press the @key{TAB} key.  Also, you can run
@code{untabify} in Emacs to convert tabs in a region to multiple
spaces, or use the @code{unexpand} command from the shell.

@end itemize


@node Comments
@section Comments

@cindex Comments
@findex comment
@findex c @r{(comment)}

You can write comments in a Texinfo file that will not appear in
either the Info file or the printed manual by using the
@code{@@comment} command (which may be abbreviated to @code{@@c}).
Such comments are for the person who revises the Texinfo file.  All the
text on a line that follows either @code{@@comment} or @code{@@c} is a
comment; the rest of the line does not appear in either the Info file
or the printed manual.

Often, you can write the @code{@@comment} or @code{@@c} in the middle of
a line, and only the text that follows after the @code{@@comment} or
@code{@@c} command does not appear; but some commands, such as
@code{@@settitle} and @code{@@setfilename}, work on a whole line.  You
cannot use @code{@@comment} or @code{@@c} in a line beginning with such
a command.

@findex DEL @r{(comment)}
In cases of nested command invocations, complicated macro definitions,
etc., @code{@@c} and @code{@@comment} may provoke an error when
processing with @TeX{}.  Therefore, you can also use the @kbd{DEL}
character (ASCII 127 decimal, 0x7f hex, 0177 octal) as a true @TeX{}
comment character (catcode 14, in @TeX{} internals).  Everything on
the line after the @kbd{DEL} will be ignored.

@cindex Ignored text
@cindex Unprocessed text
@findex ignore
You can write long stretches of text that will not appear in either
the Info file or the printed manual by using the @code{@@ignore} and
@code{@@end ignore} commands.  Write each of these commands on a line
of its own, starting each command at the beginning of the line.  Text
between these two commands does not appear in the processed output.
You can use @code{@@ignore} and @code{@@end ignore} for writing
comments.

Text enclosed by @code{@@ignore} or by failing @code{@@ifset} or
@code{@@ifclear} conditions is ignored in the sense that it will not
contribute to the formatted output.  However, @TeX{} and makeinfo must
still parse the ignored text, in order to understand when to @emph{stop}
ignoring text from the source file; that means that you may still get
error messages if you have invalid Texinfo commands within ignored text.


@node Minimum
@section What a Texinfo File Must Have
@cindex Minimal Texinfo file (requirements)
@cindex Must have in Texinfo file
@cindex Required in Texinfo file
@cindex Texinfo file minimum

By convention, the name of a Texinfo file ends with (in order of
preference) one of the extensions @file{.texinfo}, @file{.texi},
@file{.txi}, or @file{.tex}.  The longer extensions are preferred since
they describe more clearly to a human reader the nature of the file.
The shorter extensions are for operating systems that cannot handle long
file names.

In order to be made into a printed manual and an Info file, a Texinfo
file @strong{must} begin with lines like this:

@example
@group
\input texinfo
@@setfilename @var{info-file-name}
@@settitle @var{name-of-manual}
@end group
@end example

@noindent
The contents of the file follow this beginning, and then you
@strong{must} end a Texinfo file with a line like this:

@example
@@bye
@end example

@findex \input @r{(raw @TeX{} startup)}
@noindent
Here's an explanation:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The @samp{\input texinfo} line tells @TeX{} to use the
@file{texinfo.tex} file, which tells @TeX{} how to translate the Texinfo
@@-commands into @TeX{} typesetting commands.  (Note the use of the
backslash, @samp{\}; this is correct for @TeX{}.)

@item
The @code{@@setfilename} line provides a name for the Info file and
tells @TeX{} to open auxiliary files.  @strong{All text before
@code{@@setfilename} is ignored!}

@item
The @code{@@settitle} line specifies a title for the page headers (or
footers) of the printed manual, and the default document description for
the @samp{<head>} in HTML format.  Strictly speaking, @code{@@settitle}
is optional---if you don't mind your document being titled `Untitled'.

@item
The @code{@@bye} line at the end of the file on a line of its own tells
the formatters that the file is ended and to stop formatting.

@end itemize

Typically, you will not use quite such a spare format, but will include
mode setting and start-of-header and end-of-header lines at the
beginning of a Texinfo file, like this:

@example
@group
\input texinfo   @@c -*-texinfo-*-
@@c %**start of header
@@setfilename @var{info-file-name}
@@settitle @var{name-of-manual}
@@c %**end of header
@end group
@end example

@noindent
In the first line, @samp{-*-texinfo-*-} causes Emacs to switch into
Texinfo mode when you edit the file.

The @code{@@c} lines which surround the @code{@@setfilename} and
@code{@@settitle} lines are optional, but you need them in order to
run @TeX{} or Info on just part of the file.  (@xref{Start of Header}.)

Furthermore, you will usually provide a Texinfo file with a title page,
indices, and the like, all of which are explained in this manual.  But
the minimum, which can be useful for short documents, is just the three
lines at the beginning and the one line at the end.


@node Six Parts
@section Six Parts of a Texinfo File

Generally, a Texinfo file contains more than the minimal beginning and
end described in the previous section---it usually contains the six
parts listed below.  These are described fully in the following sections.

@table @r
@item 1. Header
The @dfn{Header} names the file, tells @TeX{} which definitions file to
use, and other such housekeeping tasks.

@item 2. Summary and Copyright
The @dfn{Summary and Copyright} segment describes the document and
contains the copyright notice and copying permissions.  This is done
with the @code{@@copying} command.

@item 3. Title and Copyright
The @dfn{Title and Copyright} segment contains the title and copyright
pages for the printed manual.  The segment must be enclosed between
@code{@@titlepage} and @code{@@end titlepage} commands.  The title and
copyright page appear only in the printed manual.

@item 4. `Top' Node and Master Menu
The `Top' node starts off the online output; it does not appear in the
printed manual.  We recommend including the copying permissions here as
well as the segments above.  And it contains at least a top-level menu
listing the chapters, and possibly a @dfn{Master Menu} listing all the
nodes in the entire document.

@item 5. Body
The @dfn{Body} of the document is typically structured like a
traditional book or encyclopedia, but it may be free form.

@item 6. End
The @dfn{End} segment may contain commands for printing indices, and
closes with the @code{@@bye} command on a line of its own.
@end table


@node Short Sample
@section A Short Sample Texinfo File
@cindex Sample Texinfo file, with comments

Here is a very short but complete Texinfo file, in the six conventional
parts enumerated in the previous section, so you can see how Texinfo
source appears in practice.  The first three parts of the file, from
@samp{\input texinfo} through to @samp{@@end titlepage}, look more
intimidating than they are: most of the material is standard
boilerplate; when writing a manual, you simply change the names as
appropriate.

@xref{Beginning a File}, for full documentation on the commands listed
here.  @xref{GNU Sample Texts}, for the full texts to be used in GNU
manuals.

In the following, the sample text is @emph{indented}; comments on it are
not.  The complete file, without interspersed comments, is shown in
@ref{Short Sample Texinfo File}.

@subheading Part 1: Header

@noindent
The header does not appear in either the Info file or the
printed output.  It sets various parameters, including the
name of the Info file and the title used in the header.

@example

@subheading Part 3: Titlepage, Contents, Copyright

@noindent
The titlepage segment does not appear in the online output, only in the
printed manual.  We use the @code{@@insertcopying} command to
include the permission text from the previous section, instead of
writing it out again; it is output on the back of the title page.  The
@code{@@contents} command generates a table of contents.

@example
@group
@@titlepage
@@title Sample Title
@end group

@group
@@c The following two commands start the copyright page.

@@insertcopying
@@end titlepage
@end group

@@c Output the table of contents at the beginning.
@@contents
@end example

@subheading Part 4: `Top' Node and Master Menu

@noindent
The `Top' node contains the master menu for the Info file.  Since the
printed manual uses a table of contents rather than a menu, it
excludes the `Top' node.  We repeat the short description from the
beginning of the @samp{@@copying} text, but there's no need to repeat
the copyright information, so we don't use @samp{@@insertcopying} here.
The @samp{@@top} command itself helps @command{makeinfo} determine the
relationships between nodes.

@example
@@ifnottex
@@node Top
@@top Short Sample

@end group
@end example


@subheading Part 5: The Body of the Document

@noindent
The body segment contains all the text of the document, but not the
indices or table of contents.  This example illustrates a node and a
chapter containing an enumerated list.

@subheading Part 6: The End of the Document

@noindent

unnumbered chapter of its own, and the @code{@@bye} command that marks
the end of the document.

@cindex History of Texinfo
@cindex Texinfo history
A bit of history: in the 1970's at CMU, Brian Reid developed a program
and format named Scribe to mark up documents for printing.  It used the
@code{@@} character to introduce commands, as Texinfo does.  Much more
consequentially, it strove to describe document contents rather than
formatting, an idea wholeheartedly adopted by Texinfo.

@cindex Bolio
@cindex Bo@TeX{}
Meanwhile, people at MIT developed another, not too dissimilar format
called Bolio.  This then was converted to using @TeX{} as its typesetting
language: Bo@TeX{}.  The earliest Bo@TeX{} version seems to have been
0.02 on October 31, 1984.

Bo@TeX{} could only be used as a markup language for documents to be
printed, not for online documents.  Richard Stallman (RMS) worked on
both Bolio and Bo@TeX{}.  He also developed a nifty on-line help format
called Info, and then combined Bo@TeX{} and Info to create Texinfo, a
mark up language for text that is intended to be read both online and
as printed hard copy.

file is no different from any other ASCII file.  However, GNU Emacs
comes with a special mode, called Texinfo mode, that provides Emacs
commands and tools to help ease your work.

This chapter describes features of GNU Emacs' Texinfo mode but not any
features of the Texinfo formatting language.  So if you are reading this
manual straight through from the beginning, you may want to skim through
this chapter briefly and come back to it after reading succeeding
chapters which describe the Texinfo formatting language in detail.

@node Texinfo Mode Overview
@section Texinfo Mode Overview

Texinfo mode provides special features for working with Texinfo files.
You can:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Insert frequently used @@-commands. @refill

@item
Automatically create @code{@@node} lines.

@item
Show the structure of a Texinfo source file.@refill

@item
Automatically create or update the `Next',
`Previous', and `Up' pointers of a node.

@item
Automatically create or update menus.@refill

@item
Automatically create a master menu.@refill

@item
Format a part or all of a file for Info.@refill

@item
Typeset and print part or all of a file.@refill
@end itemize

Perhaps the two most helpful features are those for inserting frequently
used @@-commands and for creating node pointers and menus.@refill

@node Emacs Editing
@section The Usual GNU Emacs Editing Commands

In most cases, the usual Text mode commands work the same in Texinfo
mode as they do in Text mode.  Texinfo mode adds new editing commands
and tools to GNU Emacs' general purpose editing features.  The major
difference concerns filling.  In Texinfo mode, the paragraph
separation variable and syntax table are redefined so that Texinfo
commands that should be on lines of their own are not inadvertently
included in paragraphs.  Thus, the @kbd{M-q} (@code{fill-paragraph})
command will refill a paragraph but not mix an indexing command on a
line adjacent to it into the paragraph.@refill

In addition, Texinfo mode sets the @code{page-delimiter} variable to
the value of @code{texinfo-chapter-level-regexp}; by default, this is
a regular expression matching the commands for chapters and their
equivalents, such as appendices.  With this value for the page
delimiter, you can jump from chapter title to chapter title with the
@kbd{C-x ]} (@code{forward-page}) and @kbd{C-x [}
(@code{backward-page}) commands and narrow to a chapter with the
@kbd{C-x n p} (@code{narrow-to-page}) command.  (@xref{Pages, , ,emacs,
The GNU Emacs Manual}, for details about the page commands.)@refill

You may name a Texinfo file however you wish, but the convention is to
end a Texinfo file name with one of the extensions
@file{.texinfo}, @file{.texi}, @file{.txi}, or @file{.tex}.  A longer
extension is preferred, since it is explicit, but a shorter extension
may be necessary for operating systems that limit the length of file
names.  GNU Emacs automatically enters Texinfo mode when you visit a
file with a @file{.texinfo}, @file{.texi} or @file{.txi}
extension.  Also, Emacs switches to Texinfo mode
when you visit a
file that has @samp{-*-texinfo-*-} in its first line.  If ever you are
in another mode and wish to switch to Texinfo mode, type @code{M-x
texinfo-mode}.@refill

Like all other Emacs features, you can customize or enhance Texinfo
mode as you wish.  In particular, the keybindings are very easy to
change.  The keybindings described here are the default or standard
ones.@refill

@node Inserting
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Inserting Frequently Used Commands
@cindex Inserting frequently used commands
@cindex Frequently used commands, inserting
@cindex Commands, inserting them

Texinfo mode provides commands to insert various frequently used
@@-commands into the buffer.  You can use these commands to save
keystrokes.@refill

The insert commands are invoked by typing @kbd{C-c} twice and then the
first letter of the @@-command:@refill

@table @kbd
@item  C-c C-c c
@itemx M-x texinfo-insert-@@code
@findex texinfo-insert-@@code
Insert @code{@@code@{@}} and put the
cursor between the braces.@refill

@item  C-c C-c d
@itemx M-x texinfo-insert-@@dfn
@findex texinfo-insert-@@dfn
Insert @code{@@dfn@{@}} and put the
cursor between the braces.@refill

@item  C-c C-c e
@itemx M-x texinfo-insert-@@end
@findex texinfo-insert-@@end
Insert @code{@@end} and attempt to insert the correct following word,
such as @samp{example} or @samp{table}.  (This command does not handle
nested lists correctly, but inserts the word appropriate to the
immediately preceding list.)@refill

@item  C-c C-c i
@itemx M-x texinfo-insert-@@item
@findex texinfo-insert-@@item
Insert @code{@@item} and put the
cursor at the beginning of the next line.@refill

@item  C-c C-c k
@itemx M-x texinfo-insert-@@kbd
@findex texinfo-insert-@@kbd
Insert @code{@@kbd@{@}} and put the
cursor between the braces.@refill

@item  C-c C-c n
@itemx M-x texinfo-insert-@@node
@findex texinfo-insert-@@node
Insert @code{@@node} and a comment line
listing the sequence for the `Next',
`Previous', and `Up' nodes.
Leave point after the @code{@@node}.@refill

@item  C-c C-c o
@itemx M-x texinfo-insert-@@noindent
@findex texinfo-insert-@@noindent
Insert @code{@@noindent} and put the
cursor at the beginning of the next line.@refill

@item  C-c C-c s
@itemx M-x texinfo-insert-@@samp
@findex texinfo-insert-@@samp
Insert @code{@@samp@{@}} and put the
cursor between the braces.@refill

@item  C-c C-c t
@itemx M-x texinfo-insert-@@table
@findex texinfo-insert-@@table
Insert @code{@@table} followed by a @key{SPC}
and leave the cursor after the @key{SPC}.@refill

@item  C-c C-c v
@itemx M-x texinfo-insert-@@var
@findex texinfo-insert-@@var
Insert @code{@@var@{@}} and put the
cursor between the braces.@refill

@item  C-c C-c x
@itemx M-x texinfo-insert-@@example
@findex texinfo-insert-@@example
Insert @code{@@example} and put the
cursor at the beginning of the next line.@refill

@c M-@{  was the binding for texinfo-insert-braces;
@c in Emacs 19, backward-paragraph will take this binding.
@item C-c C-c @{
@itemx M-x texinfo-insert-braces
@findex texinfo-insert-braces
Insert @code{@{@}} and put the cursor between the braces.@refill

@item C-c @}
@itemx C-c  ]
@itemx M-x up-list
@findex up-list
Move from between a pair of braces forward past the closing brace.
Typing @kbd{C-c ]} is easier than typing @kbd{C-c @}}, which
is, however, more mnemonic; hence the two keybindings.  (Also, you can
move out from between braces by typing @kbd{C-f}.)@refill
@end table

To put a command such as @w{@code{@@code@{@dots{}@}}} around an
@emph{existing} word, position the cursor in front of the word and type
@kbd{C-u 1 C-c C-c c}.  This makes it easy to edit existing plain text.
The value of the prefix argument tells Emacs how many words following
point to include between braces---@samp{1} for one word, @samp{2} for
two words, and so on.  Use a negative argument to enclose the previous
word or words.  If you do not specify a prefix argument, Emacs inserts
the @@-command string and positions the cursor between the braces.  This
feature works only for those @@-commands that operate on a word or words
within one line, such as @code{@@kbd} and @code{@@var}.@refill

This set of insert commands was created after analyzing the frequency
with which different @@-commands are used in the @cite{GNU Emacs
Manual} and the @cite{GDB Manual}.  If you wish to add your own insert
commands, you can bind a keyboard macro to a key, use abbreviations,
or extend the code in @file{texinfo.el}.@refill

@findex texinfo-start-menu-description
@cindex Menu description, start
@cindex Description for menu, start
@kbd{C-c C-c C-d} (@code{texinfo-start-menu-description}) is an insert
command that works differently from the other insert commands.  It
inserts a node's section or chapter title in the space for the
description in a menu entry line.  (A menu entry has three parts, the
entry name, the node name, and the description.  Only the node name is
required, but a description helps explain what the node is about.
@xref{Menu Parts, , The Parts of a Menu}.)@refill

To use @code{texinfo-start-menu-description}, position point in a menu
entry line and type @kbd{C-c C-c C-d}.  The command looks for and copies
the title that goes with the node name, and inserts the title as a
description; it positions point at beginning of the inserted text so you
can edit it.  The function does not insert the title if the menu entry
line already contains a description.@refill

This command is only an aid to writing descriptions; it does not do the
whole job.  You must edit the inserted text since a title tends to use
the same words as a node name but a useful description uses different
words.@refill

@node Showing the Structure
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Showing the Section Structure of a File
@cindex Showing the section structure of a file
@cindex Section structure of a file, showing it
@cindex Structure of a file, showing it
@cindex Outline of file structure, showing it
@cindex Contents-like outline of file structure
@cindex File section structure, showing it
@cindex Texinfo file section structure, showing it

You can show the section structure of a Texinfo file by using the
@kbd{C-c C-s} command (@code{texinfo-show-structure}).  This command
shows the section structure of a Texinfo file by listing the lines
that begin with the @@-commands for @code{@@chapter},
@code{@@section}, and the like.  It constructs what amounts
to a table of contents.  These lines are displayed in another buffer
called the @samp{*Occur*} buffer.  In that buffer, you can position
the cursor over one of the lines and use the @kbd{C-c C-c} command
(@code{occur-mode-goto-occurrence}), to jump to the corresponding spot
in the Texinfo file.@refill

@table @kbd
@item  C-c C-s
@itemx M-x texinfo-show-structure
@findex texinfo-show-structure
Show the @code{@@chapter}, @code{@@section}, and such lines of a
Texinfo file.@refill

@item  C-c C-c
@itemx M-x occur-mode-goto-occurrence
@findex occur-mode-goto-occurrence
Go to the line in the Texinfo file corresponding to the line under the
cursor in the @file{*Occur*} buffer.@refill
@end table

If you call @code{texinfo-show-structure} with a prefix argument by
typing @w{@kbd{C-u C-c C-s}}, it will list not only those lines with the
@@-commands for @code{@@chapter}, @code{@@section}, and the like, but
also the @code{@@node} lines.  You can use @code{texinfo-show-structure}
with a prefix argument to check whether the `Next', `Previous', and `Up'
pointers of an @code{@@node} line are correct.

Often, when you are working on a manual, you will be interested only
in the structure of the current chapter.  In this case, you can mark
off the region of the buffer that you are interested in by using the
@kbd{C-x n n} (@code{narrow-to-region}) command and
@code{texinfo-show-structure} will work on only that region.  To see
the whole buffer again, use @w{@kbd{C-x n w}} (@code{widen}).
(@xref{Narrowing, , , emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}, for more
information about the narrowing commands.)@refill

@vindex page-delimiter
@cindex Page delimiter in Texinfo mode
In addition to providing the @code{texinfo-show-structure} command,
Texinfo mode sets the value of the page delimiter variable to match
the chapter-level @@-commands.  This enables you to use the @kbd{C-x
]} (@code{forward-page}) and @kbd{C-x [} (@code{backward-page})
commands to move forward and backward by chapter, and to use the
@kbd{C-x n p} (@code{narrow-to-page}) command to narrow to a chapter.
@xref{Pages, , , emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}, for more information
about the page commands.@refill

@section Updating Nodes and Menus
@cindex Updating nodes and menus
@cindex Create nodes, menus automatically

@cindex Automatically insert nodes, menus

Texinfo mode provides commands for automatically creating or updating
menus and node pointers.  The commands are called ``update'' commands
because their most frequent use is for updating a Texinfo file after you
have worked on it; but you can use them to insert the `Next',
`Previous', and `Up' pointers into an @code{@@node} line that has none
and to create menus in a file that has none.

If you do not use the updating commands, you need to write menus and
node pointers by hand, which is a tedious task.@refill

@end menu

@node Updating Commands
@subsection The Updating Commands

You can use the updating commands to:@refill

@itemize @bullet
@item
insert or update the `Next', `Previous', and `Up' pointers of a
node,@refill

@item
insert or update the menu for a section, and@refill

@item
create a master menu for a Texinfo source file.@refill
@end itemize

You can also use the commands to update all the nodes and menus in a
region or in a whole Texinfo file.@refill

The updating commands work only with conventional Texinfo files, which
are structured hierarchically like books.  In such files, a structuring
command line must follow closely after each @code{@@node} line, except
for the `Top' @code{@@node} line.  (A @dfn{structuring command line} is
a line beginning with @code{@@chapter}, @code{@@section}, or other
similar command.)

You can write the structuring command line on the line that follows
immediately after an @code{@@node} line or else on the line that
follows after a single @code{@@comment} line or a single
@code{@@ifinfo} line.  You cannot interpose more than one line between
the @code{@@node} line and the structuring command line; and you may
interpose only an @code{@@comment} line or an @code{@@ifinfo} line.

Commands which work on a whole buffer require that the `Top' node be
followed by a node with an @code{@@chapter} or equivalent-level command.
The menu updating commands will not create a main or master menu for a
Texinfo file that has only @code{@@chapter}-level nodes!  The menu
updating commands only create menus @emph{within} nodes for lower level
nodes.  To create a menu of chapters, you must provide a `Top'
node.

The menu updating commands remove menu entries that refer to other Info
files since they do not refer to nodes within the current buffer.  This
is a deficiency.  Rather than use menu entries, you can use cross
references to refer to other Info files.  None of the updating commands
affect cross references.@refill

Texinfo mode has five updating commands that are used most often: two
are for updating the node pointers or menu of a single node (or a
region); two are for updating every node pointer and menu in a file;
and one, the @code{texinfo-master-menu} command, is for creating a
master menu for a complete file, and optionally, for updating every
node and menu in the whole Texinfo file.@refill

The @code{texinfo-master-menu} command is the primary command:@refill

@table @kbd
@item C-c C-u m
@itemx M-x texinfo-master-menu
@findex texinfo-master-menu
Create or update a master menu that includes all the other menus
(incorporating the descriptions from pre-existing menus, if
any).@refill

With an argument (prefix argument, @kbd{C-u,} if interactive), first create or
update all the nodes and all the regular menus in the buffer before
constructing the master menu.  (@xref{The Top Node, , The Top Node and
Master Menu}, for more about a master menu.)@refill

For @code{texinfo-master-menu} to work, the Texinfo file must have a
`Top' node and at least one subsequent node.@refill

After extensively editing a Texinfo file, you can type the following:

@example
C-u M-x texinfo-master-menu
@exdent or
C-u C-c C-u m
@end example

@noindent
This updates all the nodes and menus completely and all at once.@refill
@end table

The other major updating commands do smaller jobs and are designed for
the person who updates nodes and menus as he or she writes a Texinfo
file.@refill

@need 1000
The commands are:@refill

@table @kbd
@item C-c C-u C-n
@itemx M-x texinfo-update-node
@findex texinfo-update-node
Insert the `Next', `Previous', and `Up' pointers for the node that point is
within (i.e., for the @code{@@node} line preceding point).  If the
@code{@@node} line has pre-existing `Next', `Previous', or `Up'
pointers in it, the old pointers are removed and new ones inserted.
With an argument (prefix argument, @kbd{C-u}, if interactive), this command
updates all @code{@@node} lines in the region (which is the text
between point and mark).@refill

@item C-c C-u C-m
@itemx M-x texinfo-make-menu
@findex texinfo-make-menu
Create or update the menu in the node that point is within.
With an argument (@kbd{C-u} as prefix argument, if
interactive), the command makes or updates menus for the
nodes which are either within or a part of the
region.@refill

Whenever @code{texinfo-make-menu} updates an existing menu, the
descriptions from that menu are incorporated into the new menu.  This
is done by copying descriptions from the existing menu to the entries
in the new menu that have the same node names.  If the node names are
different, the descriptions are not copied to the new menu.@refill

@item C-c C-u C-e
@itemx M-x texinfo-every-node-update
@findex texinfo-every-node-update
Insert or update the `Next', `Previous', and `Up' pointers for every
node in the buffer.@refill

@item C-c C-u C-a
@itemx M-x texinfo-all-menus-update
@findex texinfo-all-menus-update
Create or update all the menus in the buffer.  With an argument
(@kbd{C-u} as prefix argument, if interactive), first insert
or update all the node
pointers before working on the menus.@refill

If a master menu exists, the @code{texinfo-all-menus-update} command
updates it; but the command does not create a new master menu if none
already exists.  (Use the @code{texinfo-master-menu} command for
that.)@refill

When working on a document that does not merit a master menu, you can
type the following:

@example
C-u C-c C-u C-a
@exdent or
C-u M-x texinfo-all-menus-update
@end example

@noindent
This updates all the nodes and menus.@refill
@end table

The @code{texinfo-column-for-description} variable specifies the
column to which menu descriptions are indented.  By default, the value
is 32 although it can be useful to reduce it to as low as 24.  You
can set the variable via customization (@pxref{Changing an Option,,,
emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}) or with the @kbd{M-x set-variable}
command (@pxref{Examining, , Examining and Setting Variables, emacs,
The GNU Emacs Manual}).

Also, the @code{texinfo-indent-menu-description} command may be used to
indent existing menu descriptions to a specified column.  Finally, if
you wish, you can use the @code{texinfo-insert-node-lines} command to
insert missing @code{@@node} lines into a file.  (@xref{Other Updating
Commands}, for more information.)@refill

@node Updating Requirements
@subsection Updating Requirements
@cindex Updating requirements
@cindex Requirements for updating commands

To use the updating commands, you must organize the Texinfo file
hierarchically with chapters, sections, subsections, and the like.
When you construct the hierarchy of the manual, do not `jump down'
more than one level at a time: you can follow the `Top' node with a
chapter, but not with a section; you can follow a chapter with a
section, but not with a subsection.  However, you may `jump up' any
number of levels at one time---for example, from a subsection to a
chapter.@refill

Each @code{@@node} line, with the exception of the line for the `Top'
node, must be followed by a line with a structuring command such as
@code{@@chapter}, @code{@@section}, or
@code{@@unnumberedsubsec}.@refill

Each @code{@@node} line/structuring-command line combination
must look either like this:

@example
@group
@@node     Comments,  Minimum, Conventions, Overview
@@comment  node-name, next,    previous,    up
@@section Comments
@end group
@end example

or like this (without the @code{@@comment} line):

@example
@group
@@node Comments, Minimum, Conventions, Overview
@@section Comments
@end group
@end example

or like this (without the explicit node pointers):

@example
@group
@@node Comments
@@section Comments
@end group
@end example

@noindent
In this example, `Comments' is the name of both the node and the
section.  The next node is called `Minimum' and the previous node is
called `Conventions'.  The `Comments' section is within the `Overview'
node, which is specified by the `Up' pointer.  (Instead of an
@code{@@comment} line, you may also write an @code{@@ifinfo} line.)

If a file has a `Top' node, it must be called @samp{top} or @samp{Top}
and be the first node in the file.

The menu updating commands create a menu of sections within a chapter,
a menu of subsections within a section, and so on.  This means that
you must have a `Top' node if you want a menu of chapters.@refill

Incidentally, the @code{makeinfo} command will create an Info file for a
hierarchically organized Texinfo file that lacks `Next', `Previous' and
`Up' pointers.  Thus, if you can be sure that your Texinfo file will be
formatted with @code{makeinfo}, you have no need for the update node
commands.  (@xref{Creating an Info File}, for more information about
@code{makeinfo}.)  However, both @code{makeinfo} and the
@code{texinfo-format-@dots{}} commands require that you insert menus in
the file.


@node Other Updating Commands
@subsection Other Updating Commands

In addition to the five major updating commands, Texinfo mode
possesses several less frequently used updating commands:@refill

@table @kbd
@item M-x texinfo-insert-node-lines
@findex texinfo-insert-node-lines
Insert @code{@@node} lines before the @code{@@chapter},
@code{@@section}, and other sectioning commands wherever they are
missing throughout a region in a Texinfo file.@refill

With an argument (@kbd{C-u} as prefix argument, if interactive), the
@code{texinfo-insert-node-lines} command not only inserts
@code{@@node} lines but also inserts the chapter or section titles as
the names of the corresponding nodes.  In addition, it inserts the
titles as node names in pre-existing @code{@@node} lines that lack
names.  Since node names should be more concise than section or
chapter titles, you must manually edit node names so inserted.@refill

For example, the following marks a whole buffer as a region and inserts
@code{@@node} lines and titles throughout:@refill

@example
C-x h C-u M-x texinfo-insert-node-lines
@end example

This command inserts titles as node names in @code{@@node} lines; the
@code{texinfo-start-menu-description} command (@pxref{Inserting,
Inserting Frequently Used Commands}) inserts titles as descriptions in
menu entries, a different action.  However, in both cases, you need to
edit the inserted text.

@item M-x texinfo-multiple-files-update
@findex texinfo-multiple-files-update @r{(in brief)}
Update nodes and menus in a document built from several separate files.
With @kbd{C-u} as a prefix argument, create and insert a master menu in
the outer file.  With a numeric prefix argument, such as @kbd{C-u 2}, first
update all the menus and all the `Next', `Previous', and `Up' pointers
of all the included files before creating and inserting a master menu in
the outer file.  The @code{texinfo-multiple-files-update} command is
described in the appendix on @code{@@include} files.
@xref{texinfo-multiple-files-update}.

@item M-x texinfo-indent-menu-description
@findex texinfo-indent-menu-description
Indent every description in the menu following point to the specified
column.  You can use this command to give yourself more space for
descriptions.  With an argument (@kbd{C-u} as prefix argument, if
interactive), the @code{texinfo-indent-menu-description} command indents
every description in every menu in the region.  However, this command
does not indent the second and subsequent lines of a multi-line
description.@refill

@item M-x texinfo-sequential-node-update
@findex texinfo-sequential-node-update
Insert the names of the nodes immediately following and preceding the
current node as the `Next' or `Previous' pointers regardless of those
nodes' hierarchical level.  This means that the `Next' node of a
subsection may well be the next chapter.  Sequentially ordered nodes are
useful for novels and other documents that you read through
sequentially.  (However, in Info, the @kbd{g *} command lets
you look through the file sequentially, so sequentially ordered nodes
are not strictly necessary.)  With an argument (prefix argument, if
interactive), the @code{texinfo-sequential-node-update} command
sequentially updates all the nodes in the region.@refill
@end table

@node Info Formatting
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Formatting for Info
@cindex Formatting for Info
@cindex Running an Info formatter
@cindex Info formatting

Texinfo mode provides several commands for formatting part or all of a
Texinfo file for Info.  Often, when you are writing a document, you
want to format only part of a file---that is, a region.@refill

You can use either the @code{texinfo-format-region} or the
@code{makeinfo-region} command to format a region:@refill

@table @kbd
@findex texinfo-format-region
@item  C-c C-e C-r
@itemx M-x texinfo-format-region
@itemx C-c C-m C-r
@itemx M-x makeinfo-region
Format the current region for Info.@refill
@end table

You can use either the @code{texinfo-format-buffer} or the
@code{makeinfo-buffer} command to format a whole buffer:@refill

@table @kbd
@findex texinfo-format-buffer
@item  C-c C-e C-b
@itemx M-x texinfo-format-buffer
@itemx C-c C-m C-b
@itemx M-x makeinfo-buffer
Format the current buffer for Info.@refill
@end table

@need 1000
For example, after writing a Texinfo file, you can type the following:

@example
C-u C-c C-u m
@exdent or
C-u M-x texinfo-master-menu
@end example

@noindent
This updates all the nodes and menus.  Then type the following to create
an Info file:

@example
C-c C-m C-b
@exdent or
M-x makeinfo-buffer

For @TeX{} or the Info formatting commands to work, the file @emph{must}
include a line that has @code{@@setfilename} in its header.

@cindex Region formatting and printing

@cindex Part of file formatting and printing

Typesetting and printing a Texinfo file is a multi-step process in which
you first create a file for printing (called a DVI file), and then
print the file.  Optionally, you may also create indices.  To do this,
you must run the @code{texindex} command after first running the
@code{tex} typesetting command; and then you must run the @code{tex}
command again.  Or else run the @code{texi2dvi} command which
automatically creates indices as needed (@pxref{Format with texi2dvi}).

Often, when you are writing a document, you want to typeset and print
only part of a file to see what it will look like.  You can use the
@code{texinfo-tex-region} and related commands for this purpose.  Use
the @code{texinfo-tex-buffer} command to format all of a
buffer.@refill

@table @kbd
@item  C-c C-t C-b
@itemx M-x texinfo-tex-buffer
@findex texinfo-tex-buffer
Run @code{texi2dvi} on the buffer.  In addition to running @TeX{} on the
buffer, this command automatically creates or updates indices as
needed.@refill

@item  C-c C-t C-r
@itemx M-x texinfo-tex-region
@findex texinfo-tex-region
Run @TeX{} on the region.@refill

@item C-c C-t C-i
@itemx M-x texinfo-texindex
Run @code{texindex} to sort the indices of a Texinfo file formatted with
@code{texinfo-tex-region}.  The @code{texinfo-tex-region} command does
not run @code{texindex} automatically; it only runs the @code{tex}
typesetting command.  You must run the @code{texinfo-tex-region} command
a second time after sorting the raw index files with the @code{texindex}
command.  (Usually, you do not format an index when you format a region,
only when you format a buffer.  Now that the @code{texi2dvi} command
exists, there is little or no need for this command.)@refill

@item C-c C-t C-p
@itemx M-x texinfo-tex-print
@findex texinfo-tex-print
Print the file (or the part of the file) previously formatted with
@code{texinfo-tex-buffer} or @code{texinfo-tex-region}.@refill
@end table

For @code{texinfo-tex-region} or @code{texinfo-tex-buffer} to work, the
file @emph{must} start with a @samp{\input texinfo} line and must
include an @code{@@settitle} line.  The file must end with @code{@@bye}
on a line by itself.  (When you use @code{texinfo-tex-region}, you must
surround the @code{@@settitle} line with start-of-header and
end-of-header lines.)@refill

@node Texinfo Mode Summary
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Texinfo Mode Summary

In Texinfo mode, each set of commands has default keybindings that
begin with the same keys.  All the commands that are custom-created
for Texinfo mode begin with @kbd{C-c}.  The keys are somewhat
mnemonic.@refill

@subheading Insert Commands

The insert commands are invoked by typing @kbd{C-c} twice and then the
first letter of the @@-command to be inserted.  (It might make more
sense mnemonically to use @kbd{C-c C-i}, for `custom insert', but
@kbd{C-c C-c} is quick to type.)@refill

@example
C-c C-c c       @r{Insert} @samp{@@code}.
C-c C-c d       @r{Insert} @samp{@@dfn}.
C-c C-c e       @r{Insert} @samp{@@end}.
C-c C-c i       @r{Insert} @samp{@@item}.
C-c C-c n       @r{Insert} @samp{@@node}.
C-c C-c s       @r{Insert} @samp{@@samp}.
C-c C-c v       @r{Insert} @samp{@@var}.
C-c @{       @r{Insert braces.}
C-c ]
C-c @}       @r{Move out of enclosing braces.}

@group
C-c C-c C-d     @r{Insert a node's section title}
               @r{in the space for the description}
               @r{in a menu entry line.}
@end group
@end example

@subheading Show Structure

The @code{texinfo-show-structure} command is often used within a
narrowed region.@refill

@example
C-c C-s         @r{List all the headings.}
@end example

@subheading The Master Update Command

The @code{texinfo-master-menu} command creates a master menu; and can
be used to update every node and menu in a file as well.@refill

@c Probably should use @tables in this section.
@example
@group
C-c C-u m
M-x texinfo-master-menu
               @r{Create or update a master menu.}
@end group

@group
C-u C-c C-u m   @r{With @kbd{C-u} as a prefix argument, first}
               @r{create or update all nodes and regular}
               @r{menus, and then create a master menu.}
@end group
@end example

@subheading Update Pointers

The update pointer commands are invoked by typing @kbd{C-c C-u} and
then either @kbd{C-n} for @code{texinfo-update-node} or @kbd{C-e} for
@code{texinfo-every-node-update}.@refill

@example
C-c C-u C-n     @r{Update a node.}
C-c C-u C-e     @r{Update every node in the buffer.}
@end example

@subheading Update Menus

Invoke the  update menu commands by typing @kbd{C-c C-u}
and then either @kbd{C-m} for @code{texinfo-make-menu} or
@kbd{C-a} for @code{texinfo-all-menus-update}.  To update
both nodes and menus at the same time, precede @kbd{C-c C-u
C-a} with @kbd{C-u}.@refill

@example
C-c C-u C-m     @r{Make or update a menu.}

@group
C-c C-u C-a     @r{Make or update all}
               @r{menus in a buffer.}
@end group

@group
C-u C-c C-u C-a @r{With @kbd{C-u} as a prefix argument,}
               @r{first create or update all nodes and}
               @r{then create or update all menus.}
@end group
@end example

@subheading Format for Info

The Info formatting commands that are written in Emacs Lisp are
invoked by typing @kbd{C-c C-e} and then either @kbd{C-r} for a region
or @kbd{C-b} for the whole buffer.@refill

The Info formatting commands that are written in C and based on the
@code{makeinfo} program are invoked by typing @kbd{C-c C-m} and then
either @kbd{C-r} for a region or @kbd{C-b} for the whole buffer.@refill

@need 800
@noindent
Use the @code{texinfo-format@dots{}} commands:

@example
@group
C-c C-e C-r     @r{Format the region.}
C-c C-e C-b     @r{Format the buffer.}
@end group
@end example

@need 750
@noindent
Use @code{makeinfo}:

@example
C-c C-m C-r     @r{Format the region.}
C-c C-m C-b     @r{Format the buffer.}
C-c C-m C-l     @r{Recenter the @code{makeinfo} output buffer.}
C-c C-m C-k     @r{Kill the @code{makeinfo} formatting job.}
@end example

@subheading Typeset and Print

The @TeX{} typesetting and printing commands are invoked by typing
@kbd{C-c C-t} and then another control command: @kbd{C-r} for
@code{texinfo-tex-region}, @kbd{C-b} for @code{texinfo-tex-buffer},
and so on.@refill

@example
C-c C-t C-r     @r{Run @TeX{} on the region.}
C-c C-t C-b     @r{Run} @code{texi2dvi} @r{on the buffer.}
C-c C-t C-i     @r{Run} @code{texindex}.
C-c C-t C-p     @r{Print the DVI file.}
C-c C-t C-q     @r{Show the print queue.}
C-c C-t C-d     @r{Delete a job from the print queue.}
C-c C-t C-k     @r{Kill the current @TeX{} formatting job.}
C-c C-t C-x     @r{Quit a currently stopped @TeX{} formatting job.}
C-c C-t C-l     @r{Recenter the output buffer.}
@end example

@subheading Other Updating Commands

The remaining updating commands do not have standard keybindings because
they are rarely used.

@example
@group
M-x texinfo-insert-node-lines
               @r{Insert missing @code{@@node} lines in region.}
               @r{With @kbd{C-u} as a prefix argument,}
               @r{use section titles as node names.}
@end group

@group
M-x texinfo-multiple-files-update
               @r{Update a multi-file document.}
               @r{With @kbd{C-u 2} as a prefix argument,}
               @r{create or update all nodes and menus}
               @r{in all included files first.}
@end group

@group
M-x texinfo-indent-menu-description
               @r{Indent descriptions.}

Certain pieces of information must be provided at the beginning of a
Texinfo file, such as the name for the output file(s), the title of the
document, and the Top node.  A table of contents is also generally
produced here.

This chapter expands on the minimal complete Texinfo source file
previously given (@pxref{Six Parts}).  It describes the numerous
commands for handling the traditional frontmatter items in Texinfo.

@cindex Frontmatter, text in
Straight text outside of any command before the Top node should be
avoided.  Such text is treated differently in the different output
formats: visible in @TeX{} and HTML, by default not shown in Info
readers, and so on.

@node Texinfo File Header
@section Texinfo File Header
@cindex Header for Texinfo files
@cindex Texinfo file header

Texinfo files start with at least three lines that provide Info and
@TeX{} with necessary information.  These are the @code{\input texinfo}
line, the @code{@@settitle} line, and the @code{@@setfilename} line.

Also, if you want to format just part of the Texinfo file, you must
write the @code{@@settitle} and @code{@@setfilename} lines between
start-of-header and end-of-header lines.  The start- and end-of-header
lines are optional, but they do no harm, so you might as well always
include them.

Any command that affects document formatting as a whole makes sense to
include in the header.  @code{@@synindex} (@pxref{synindex}), for
instance, is another command often included in the header.  @xref{GNU
Sample Texts}, for complete sample texts.

Thus, the beginning of a Texinfo file generally looks like this:

@example
@group
\input texinfo   @@c -*-texinfo-*-
@@c %**start of header
@@setfilename sample.info
@@settitle Sample Manual 1.0
@@c %**end of header
@end group
@end example

* settitle::                    Create a title for the printed work.
* End of Header::               Formatting a region requires this.
@end menu


@node First Line
@subsection The First Line of a Texinfo File
@cindex First line of a Texinfo file
@cindex Beginning line of a Texinfo file
@cindex Header of a Texinfo file

Every Texinfo file that is to be the top-level input to @TeX{} must begin
with a line that looks like this:

@example
\input texinfo   @@c -*-texinfo-*-
@end example

@noindent
This line serves two functions:

@enumerate
@item
When the file is processed by @TeX{}, the @samp{\input texinfo} command
tells @TeX{} to load the macros needed for processing a Texinfo file.
These are in a file called @file{texinfo.tex}, which should have been
installed on your system along with either the @TeX{} or Texinfo
software.  @TeX{} uses the backslash, @samp{\}, to mark the beginning of
a command, exactly as Texinfo uses @samp{@@}.  The @file{texinfo.tex}
file causes the switch from @samp{\} to @samp{@@}; before the switch
occurs, @TeX{} requires @samp{\}, which is why it appears at the
beginning of the file.

@item
When the file is edited in GNU Emacs, the @samp{-*-texinfo-*-} mode
specification tells Emacs to use Texinfo mode.
@end enumerate


@node Start of Header
@subsection Start of Header
@cindex Start of header line

A start-of-header line is a Texinfo comment that looks like this:

@example
@@c %**start of header
@end example

Write the start-of-header line on the second line of a Texinfo file.
Follow the start-of-header line with @code{@@setfilename} and
@code{@@settitle} lines and, optionally, with other commands that
globally affect the document formatting, such as @code{@@synindex} or
@code{@@footnotestyle}; and then by an end-of-header line (@pxref{End of
Header}).

The start- and end-of-header lines allow you to format only part of a
Texinfo file for Info or printing.  @xref{texinfo-format commands}.

The odd string of characters, @samp{%**}, is to ensure that no other
comment is accidentally taken for a start-of-header line.  You can
change it if you wish by setting the @code{tex-start-of-header} and/or
@code{tex-end-of-header} Emacs variables.  @xref{Texinfo Mode Printing}.


@node setfilename
@subsection @code{@@setfilename}: Set the output file name
@findex setfilename
@cindex Texinfo requires @code{@@setfilename}

In order to serve as the primary input file for either @code{makeinfo}
or @TeX{}, a Texinfo file should contain a line that looks like this:

@example
@@setfilename @var{info-file-name}
@end example

It is required for @TeX{}, and very strongly recommended for
@code{makeinfo}.

Write the @code{@@setfilename} command at the beginning of a line and
follow it on the same line by the Info file name.  Do not write anything
else on the line; anything on the line after the command is considered
part of the file name, including what would otherwise be a
comment.

@cindex Ignored before @code{@@setfilename}
@cindex @samp{\input} source line ignored
The Info formatting commands ignore everything written before the
@code{@@setfilename} line, which is why the very first line of
the file (the @code{\input} line) does not show up in the output.

The @code{@@setfilename} line specifies the name of the output file to
be generated.  This name must be different from the name of the Texinfo
file.  There are two conventions for choosing the name: you can either
remove the extension (such as @samp{.texi}) entirely from the input file
name, or, preferably, replace it with the @samp{.info} extension.

@cindex Length of file names
@cindex File name collision
@cindex Info file name, choosing
Although an explicit @samp{.info} extension is preferable, some
operating systems cannot handle long file names.  You can run into a
problem even when the file name you specify is itself short enough.
This occurs because the Info formatters split a long Info file into
short indirect subfiles, and name them by appending @samp{-1},
@samp{-2}, @dots{}, @samp{-10}, @samp{-11}, and so on, to the original
file name.  (@xref{Tag and Split Files}.)  The subfile name
@file{texinfo.info-10}, for example, is too long for old systems with a
14-character limit on filenames; so the Info file name for this document
is @file{texinfo} rather than @file{texinfo.info}.  When @code{makeinfo}
is running on operating systems such as MS-DOS which impose severe
limits on file names, it may remove some characters from the original
file name to leave enough space for the subfile suffix, thus producing
files named @file{texin-10}, @file{gcc.i12}, etc.

When producing HTML output, @code{makeinfo} will replace any extension
with @samp{html}, or add @samp{.html} if the given name has no
extension.

@pindex texinfo.cnf
The @code{@@setfilename} line produces no output when you typeset a
manual with @TeX{}, but it is nevertheless essential: it opens the
index, cross-reference, and other auxiliary files used by Texinfo, and
also reads @file{texinfo.cnf} if that file is present on your system
(@pxref{Preparing for TeX,, Preparing for @TeX{}}).

If there is no @code{@@setfilename} line, @code{makeinfo} uses the
input file name to determine the output name: first, any of the
extensions @code{.texi}, @code{.tex}, @code{.txi} or @code{.texinfo}
is removed from the input file name; then, the output format specific
extension is added---@code{.html} when generating HTML, @code{.info}
when generating Info, @enddots{}

@TeX{} determines the output file name similarly in the absence of
@code{@@setfilename}, but you should not attempt to process a Texinfo
file without @code{@@setfilename} with @TeX{}, as just described.

See also the @option{--output} option in @ref{Invoking texi2any}.


@node settitle
@subsection @code{@@settitle}: Set the document title
@findex settitle

In order to be made into a printed manual, a Texinfo file must contain
a line that looks like this:

@example
@@settitle @var{title}
@end example

Write the @code{@@settitle} command at the beginning of a line and
follow it on the same line by the title.  This tells @TeX{} the title to
use in a header or footer.  Do not write anything else on the line;
anything on the line after the command is considered part of the title,
including what would otherwise be a comment.

The @code{@@settitle} command should precede everything that generates
actual output.  The best place for it is right after the
@code{@@setfilename} command (see the previous section).

@cindex <title> HTML tag
In the HTML file produced by @command{makeinfo}, @var{title} serves as
the document @samp{<title>}.  It also becomes the default document
description in the @samp{<head>} part (@pxref{documentdescription}).

The title in the @code{@@settitle} command does not affect the title as
it appears on the title page.  Thus, the two do not need not match
exactly.  A practice we recommend is to include the version or edition
number of the manual in the @code{@@settitle} title; on the title page,
the version number generally appears as a @code{@@subtitle} so it would
be omitted from the @code{@@title}.  @xref{titlepage}.

Conventionally, when @TeX{} formats a Texinfo file for double-sided
output, the title is printed in the left-hand (even-numbered) page
headings and the current chapter title is printed in the right-hand
(odd-numbered) page headings.  (@TeX{} learns the title of each chapter
from each @code{@@chapter} command.)  By default, no page footer is
printed.

Even if you are printing in a single-sided style, @TeX{} looks for an
@code{@@settitle} command line, in case you include the manual title
in the heading.

@TeX{} prints page headings only for that text that comes after the
@code{@@end titlepage} command in the Texinfo file, or that comes
after an @code{@@headings} command that turns on headings.
(@xref{headings on off, , The @code{@@headings} Command}, for more
information.)

You may, if you wish, create your own, customized headings and footings.
@xref{Headings}, for a detailed discussion of this.


@node End of Header
@subsection End of Header
@cindex End of header line

Follow the header lines with an @w{end-of-header} line, which is a
Texinfo comment that looks like this:

@example
@@c %**end of header
@end example

@xref{Start of Header}.


@node Document Permissions
@section Document Permissions
@cindex Document Permissions
@cindex Copying Permissions

The copyright notice and copying permissions for a document need to
appear in several places in the various Texinfo output formats.
Therefore, Texinfo provides a command (@code{@@copying}) to declare
this text once, and another command (@code{@@insertcopying}) to
insert the text at appropriate points.

@menu
* copying::                     Declare the document's copying permissions.
* insertcopying::               Where to insert the permissions.
@end menu


@node copying
@subsection @code{@@copying}: Declare Copying Permissions
@findex copying

The @code{@@copying} command should be given very early in the document;
the recommended location is right after the header material
(@pxref{Texinfo File Header}).  It conventionally consists of a sentence
or two about what the program is, identification of the documentation
itself, the legal copyright line, and the copying permissions.  Here is
a skeletal example:

@example
@@copying
This manual is for @var{program} (version @var{version}, updated
@var{date}), which @dots{}

Copyright @@copyright@{@} @var{years} @var{copyright-owner}.

@@quotation
Permission is granted to @dots{}
@@end quotation
@@end copying
@end example

The @code{@@quotation} has no legal significance; it's there to improve
readability in some contexts.

@xref{GNU Sample Texts}, for the full text to be used in GNU manuals.
@xref{GNU Free Documentation License}, for the license itself under
which GNU and other free manuals are distributed.  You need to include
the license as an appendix to your document.

The text of @code{@@copying} is output as a comment at the beginning of
Info, HTML, and XML output files.  It is @emph{not} output implicitly in
plain text or @TeX{}; it's up to you to use @code{@@insertcopying} to
emit the copying information.  See the next section for details.

@findex copyright
The @code{@@copyright@{@}} command generates a @samp{c} inside a circle
in output formats that support this (print and HTML).  In the other
formats (Info and plain text), it generates @samp{(C)}.  The copyright
notice itself has the following legally defined sequence:

@example
Copyright @copyright{} @var{years} @var{copyright-owner}.
@end example

@cindex Copyright word, always in English
The word `Copyright' must always be written in English, even if the
document is otherwise written in another language.  This is due to
international law.

@cindex Years, in copyright line
The list of years should include all years in which a version was
completed (even if it was released in a subsequent year).  Ranges are
not allowed; each year must be written out individually and in full,
separated by commas.

@cindex Copyright holder for FSF works
@cindex Holder of copyright for FSF works
@cindex Owner of copyright for FSF works
The copyright owner (or owners) is whoever holds legal copyright on the
work.  In the case of works assigned to the FSF, the owner is `Free
Software Foundation, Inc.'.

The copyright `line' may actually be split across multiple lines, both
in the source document and in the output.  This often happens for
documents with a long history, having many different years of
publication.  If you do use several lines, do not indent any of them
(or anything else in the @code{@@copying} block) in the source file.

@xref{Copyright Notices,,,maintain,GNU Maintenance Instructions}, for
additional information.


@node insertcopying
@subsection @code{@@insertcopying}: Include Permissions Text
@findex insertcopying
@cindex Copying text, including
@cindex Permissions text, including
@cindex Including permissions text

The @code{@@insertcopying} command is simply written on a line by
itself, like this:

@example
@@insertcopying
@end example

This inserts the text previously defined by @code{@@copying}.  To meet
legal requirements, it must be used on the copyright page in the printed
manual (@pxref{Copyright}).

The @code{@@copying} command itself causes the permissions text to
appear in an Info file @emph{before} the first node.  The text is also
copied into the beginning of each split Info output file, as is legally
necessary.  This location implies a human reading the manual using Info
does @emph{not} see this text (except when using the advanced Info
command @kbd{g *}), but this does not matter for legal purposes,
because the text is present.

Similarly, the @code{@@copying} text is automatically included at the
beginning of each HTML output file, as an HTML comment.  Again, this
text is not visible (unless the reader views the HTML source).

The permissions text defined by @code{@@copying} also appears
automatically at the beginning of the XML output file.


@node Titlepage & Copyright Page
@section Title and Copyright Pages

In hard copy output, the manual's name and author are usually printed on
a title page.  Copyright information is usually printed on the back of
the title page.

The title and copyright pages appear in the printed manual, but not in
the Info file.  Because of this, it is possible to use several slightly
obscure @TeX{} typesetting commands that cannot be used in an Info file.
In addition, this part of the beginning of a Texinfo file contains the
text of the copying permissions that appears in the printed manual.

@cindex Title page, for plain text
@cindex Copyright page, for plain text
You may wish to include titlepage-like information for plain text
output.  Simply place any such leading material between
@code{@@ifplaintext} and @code{@@end ifplaintext}; @command{makeinfo}
includes this when generating plain text (@samp{--plaintext}), along with
an @code{@@insertcopying}.

@end menu


@node titlepage
@subsection @code{@@titlepage}
@cindex Title page
@findex titlepage

Start the material for the title page and following copyright page
with @code{@@titlepage} on a line by itself and end it with
@code{@@end titlepage} on a line by itself.

The @code{@@end titlepage} command starts a new page and turns on page
numbering.  (@xref{Headings, , Page Headings}, for details about how to
generate page headings.)  All the material that you want to appear on
unnumbered pages should be put between the @code{@@titlepage} and
@code{@@end titlepage} commands.  You can force the table of contents to
appear there with the @code{@@setcontentsaftertitlepage} command
(@pxref{Contents}).

@findex page@r{, within @code{@@titlepage}}
By using the @code{@@page} command you can force a page break within the
region delineated by the @code{@@titlepage} and @code{@@end titlepage}
commands and thereby create more than one unnumbered page.  This is how
the copyright page is produced.  (The @code{@@titlepage} command might
perhaps have been better named the @code{@@titleandadditionalpages}
command, but that would have been rather long!)

When you write a manual about a computer program, you should write the
version of the program to which the manual applies on the title page.
If the manual changes more frequently than the program or is independent
of it, you should also include an edition number@footnote{We have found
that it is helpful to refer to versions of independent manuals as
`editions' and versions of programs as `versions'; otherwise, we find we
are liable to confuse each other in conversation by referring to both
the documentation and the software with the same words.} for the manual.
This helps readers keep track of which manual is for which version of
the program.  (The `Top' node should also contain this information; see
@ref{The Top Node}.)

Texinfo provides two main methods for creating a title page.  One method
uses the @code{@@titlefont}, @code{@@sp}, and @code{@@center} commands
to generate a title page in which the words on the page are
centered.

The second method uses the @code{@@title}, @code{@@subtitle}, and
@code{@@author} commands to create a title page with black rules under
the title and author lines and the subtitle text set flush to the
right hand side of the page.  With this method, you do not specify any
of the actual formatting of the title page.  You specify the text
you want, and Texinfo does the formatting.

You may use either method, or you may combine them; see the examples in
the sections below.

@findex shorttitlepage
@cindex Bastard title page
@cindex Title page, bastard
For extremely simple documents, and for the bastard title page in
traditional book frontmatter, Texinfo also provides a command
@code{@@shorttitlepage} which takes the rest of the line as the title.
The argument is typeset on a page by itself and followed by a blank
page.


@node titlefont center sp
@subsection @code{@@titlefont}, @code{@@center}, and @code{@@sp}
@findex titlefont
@findex center
@findex sp @r{(titlepage line spacing)}

You can use the @code{@@titlefont}, @code{@@sp}, and @code{@@center}
commands to create a title page for a printed document.  (This is the
first of the two methods for creating a title page in Texinfo.)

Use the @code{@@titlefont} command to select a large font suitable for
the title itself.  You can use @code{@@titlefont} more than once if you
have an especially long title.

For HTML output, each @code{@@titlefont} command produces an
@code{<h1>} heading, but the HTML document @code{<title>} is not
affected.  For that, you must put an @code{@@settitle} command before
the @code{@@titlefont} command (@pxref{settitle}).

@need 700
For example:

@example
@@titlefont@{Texinfo@}
@end example

Use the @code{@@center} command at the beginning of a line to center
the remaining text on that line.  Thus,

@example
@@center @@titlefont@{Texinfo@}
@end example

@noindent
centers the title, which in this example is ``Texinfo'' printed
in the title font.

Use the @code{@@sp} command to insert vertical space.  For example:

@example
@@sp 2
@end example

@noindent
This inserts two blank lines on the printed page.  (@xref{sp, ,
@code{@@sp}}, for more information about the @code{@@sp}
command.)

A template for this method looks like this:

@example
@group
@@titlepage
@@sp 10
@@center @@titlefont@{@var{name-of-manual-when-printed}@}
@@sp 2
@@center @var{subtitle-if-any}
@@sp 2
@@center @var{author}
@dots{}
@@end titlepage
@end group
@end example

The spacing of the example fits an 8.5 by 11 inch manual.

You can in fact use these commands anywhere, not just on a title page,
but since they are not logical markup commands, we don't recommend
them.

@node title subtitle author
@subsection @code{@@title}, @code{@@subtitle}, and @code{@@author}
@findex title
@findex subtitle
@findex author

You can use the @code{@@title}, @code{@@subtitle}, and @code{@@author}
commands to create a title page in which the vertical and horizontal
spacing is done for you automatically.  This contrasts with the method
described in the previous section, in which the @code{@@sp} command is
needed to adjust vertical spacing.

Write the @code{@@title}, @code{@@subtitle}, or @code{@@author}
commands at the beginning of a line followed by the title, subtitle,
or author.  These commands are only effective in @TeX{} output; it's
an error to use them anywhere except within @code{@@titlepage}.

The @code{@@title} command produces a line in which the title is set
flush to the left-hand side of the page in a larger than normal font.
The title is underlined with a black rule.  Only a single line is
allowed; the @code{@@*} command may not be used to break the title into
two lines.  To handle very long titles, you may find it profitable to
use both @code{@@title} and @code{@@titlefont}; see the final example in
this section.

The @code{@@subtitle} command sets subtitles in a normal-sized font
flush to the right-hand side of the page.

The @code{@@author} command sets the names of the author or authors in
a middle-sized font flush to the left-hand side of the page on a line
near the bottom of the title page.  The names are underlined with a
black rule that is thinner than the rule that underlines the title.
(The black rule only occurs if the @code{@@author} command line is
followed by an @code{@@page} command line.)

There are two ways to use the @code{@@author} command: you can write
the name or names on the remaining part of the line that starts with
an @code{@@author} command:

@example
@@author by Jane Smith and John Doe
@end example

@noindent
or you can write the names one above each other by using two (or more)
@code{@@author} commands:

@example
@group
@@author Jane Smith
@@author John Doe
@end group
@end example

@noindent
(Only the bottom name is underlined with a black rule.)

@need 950
A template for this method looks like this:

@example
@group
@@titlepage
@@title @var{name-of-manual-when-printed}
@@subtitle @var{subtitle-if-any}
@@subtitle @var{second-subtitle}
@@author @var{author}
@@page
@dots{}
@@end titlepage
@end group
@end example

You may also combine the @code{@@titlefont} method described in the
previous section and @code{@@title} method described in this one.  This
may be useful if you have a very long title.  Here is a real-life example:

@example
@group

@noindent
(The use of @code{@@value} here is explained in @ref{value Example}.


@node Copyright
@subsection Copyright Page
@cindex Copyright page
@cindex Printed permissions
@cindex Permissions, printed

By international treaty, the copyright notice for a book must be either
on the title page or on the back of the title page.  When the copyright
notice is on the back of the title page, that page is customarily not
numbered.  Therefore, in Texinfo, the information on the copyright page
should be within @code{@@titlepage} and @code{@@end titlepage}
commands.

@findex vskip @r{@TeX{} vertical skip}
@findex filll @r{@TeX{} dimension}
Use the @code{@@page} command to cause a page break.  To push the
copyright notice and the other text on the copyright page towards the
bottom of the page, use the following incantation after @code{@@page}:

@example
@@vskip 0pt plus 1filll
@end example

@noindent
This is a @TeX{} command that is not supported by the Info formatting
commands.  The @code{@@vskip} command inserts whitespace.  The @samp{0pt
plus 1filll} means to put in zero points of mandatory whitespace, and as
much optional whitespace as needed to push the following text to the
bottom of the page.  Note the use of three @samp{l}s in the word
@samp{filll}; this is correct.

To insert the copyright text itself, write @code{@@insertcopying}
next (@pxref{Document Permissions}):

@example
@@insertcopying
@end example

Follow the copying text by the publisher, ISBN numbers, cover art
credits, and other such information.

Here is an example putting all this together:

@example

@dots{}

@@end titlepage
@end example


@node end titlepage
@subsection Heading Generation
@findex end titlepage
@cindex Headings, page, begin to appear
@cindex Titlepage end starts headings
@cindex End titlepage starts headings

Like all @code{@@end} commands (@pxref{Quotations and Examples}), the @code{@@end titlepage} command
must be written at the beginning of a line by itself, with only one
space between the @code{@@end} and the @code{titlepage}.  It not only
marks the end of the title and copyright pages, but also causes @TeX{}
to start generating page headings and page numbers.

To repeat what is said elsewhere,  Texinfo has two standard page heading
formats, one for documents which are printed on one side of each sheet of paper
(single-sided printing), and the other for documents which are printed on both
sides of each sheet (double-sided printing).
You can specify these formats in different ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The conventional way is to write an @code{@@setchapternewpage} command
before the title page commands, and then have the @code{@@end
titlepage} command start generating page headings in the manner desired.
(@xref{setchapternewpage}.)

@item
Alternatively, you can use the @code{@@headings} command to prevent page
headings from being generated or to start them for either single or
double-sided printing.  (Write an @code{@@headings} command immediately
after the @code{@@end titlepage} command.  @xref{headings on off, , The
@code{@@headings} Command}, for more information.)@refill

@item
Or, you may specify your own page heading and footing format.
@xref{Headings, , Page Headings}, for detailed
information about page headings and footings.
@end itemize

Most documents are formatted with the standard single-sided or
double-sided format, using @code{@@setchapternewpage odd} for
double-sided printing and no @code{@@setchapternewpage} command for
single-sided printing.


@node headings on off
@subsection The @code{@@headings} Command
@findex headings

The @code{@@headings} command is rarely used.  It specifies what kind of
page headings and footings to print on each page.  Usually, this is
controlled by the @code{@@setchapternewpage} command.  You need the
@code{@@headings} command only if the @code{@@setchapternewpage} command
does not do what you want, or if you want to turn off predefined page
headings prior to defining your own.  Write an @code{@@headings} command
immediately after the @code{@@end titlepage} command.

You can use @code{@@headings} as follows:

@table @code
@item @@headings off
Turn off printing of page headings.

@item @@headings single
Turn on page headings appropriate for single-sided printing.

@item @@headings double
Turn on page headings appropriate for double-sided printing.

@item @@headings singleafter
@itemx @@headings doubleafter
Turn on @code{single} or @code{double} headings, respectively, after the
current page is output.

@item @@headings on
Turn on page headings: @code{single} if @samp{@@setchapternewpage
on}, @code{double} otherwise.
@end table

For example, suppose you write @code{@@setchapternewpage off} before the
@code{@@titlepage} command to tell @TeX{} to start a new chapter on the
same page as the end of the last chapter.  This command also causes
@TeX{} to typeset page headers for single-sided printing.  To cause
@TeX{} to typeset for double sided printing, write @code{@@headings
double} after the @code{@@end titlepage} command.

You can stop @TeX{} from generating any page headings at all by
writing @code{@@headings off} on a line of its own immediately after the
line containing the @code{@@end titlepage} command, like this:

@example
@@end titlepage
@@headings off
@end example

@noindent
The @code{@@headings off} command overrides the @code{@@end titlepage}
command, which would otherwise cause @TeX{} to print page headings.

You can also specify your own style of page heading and footing.
@xref{Headings, , Page Headings}, for more information.


@node Contents
@section Generating a Table of Contents
@cindex Table of contents
@cindex Contents, table of
@cindex Short table of contents
@findex contents
@findex summarycontents
@findex shortcontents

The @code{@@chapter}, @code{@@section}, and other structuring commands
(@pxref{Structuring}) supply the information to make up a
table of contents, but they do not cause an actual table to appear in
the manual.  To do this, you must use the @code{@@contents} and/or
@code{@@summarycontents} command(s).

@table @code
@item @@contents
Generates a table of contents in a printed manual, including all
chapters, sections, subsections, etc., as well as appendices and
unnumbered chapters.  Headings generated by @code{@@majorheading},
@code{@@chapheading}, and the other @code{@@@dots{}heading} commands
do not appear in the table of contents (@pxref{Structuring Command
Types}).

@item @@shortcontents
@itemx @@summarycontents
(@code{@@summarycontents} is a synonym for @code{@@shortcontents}.)

Generates a short or summary table of contents that lists only the
chapters, appendices, and unnumbered chapters.  Sections, subsections
and subsubsections are omitted.  Only a long manual needs a short
table of contents in addition to the full table of contents.

@end table

Both contents commands should be written on a line by themselves, and
are best placed near the beginning of the file, after the @code{@@end
titlepage} (@pxref{titlepage}).  The contents commands automatically
generate a chapter-like heading at the top of the first table of
contents page, so don't include any sectioning command such as
@code{@@unnumbered} before them.

Since an Info file uses menus instead of tables of contents, the Info
formatting commands ignore the contents commands.  But the contents are
included in plain text output (generated by @code{makeinfo
--plaintext}), unless @code{makeinfo} is writing its output to standard
output.

When @code{makeinfo} writes a short table of contents while producing
HTML output, the links in the short table of contents point to
corresponding entries in the full table of contents rather than the text
of the document. The links in the full table of contents point to the
main text of the document.

In the past, the contents commands were sometimes placed at the end of
the file, after any indices and just before the @code{@@bye}, but we
no longer recommend this.

@findex setcontentsaftertitlepage
@findex setshortcontentsaftertitlepage
@cindex Contents, after title page
@cindex Table of contents, after title page
However, since many existing Texinfo documents still do have the
@code{@@contents} at the end of the manual, if you are a user printing
a manual, you may wish to force the contents to be printed after the
title page.  You can do this by specifying
@code{@@setcontentsaftertitlepage} and/or
@code{@@setshortcontentsaftertitlepage}.  The first prints only the
main contents after the @code{@@end titlepage}; the second prints both
the short contents and the main contents.  In either case, any
subsequent @code{@@contents} or @code{@@shortcontents} is ignored
(unless, erroneously, no @code{@@end titlepage} is ever encountered).

You need to include the @code{@@set@dots{}contentsaftertitlepage}
commands early in the document (just after @code{@@setfilename}, for
example).  We recommend using @command{texi2dvi} (@pxref{Format with
texi2dvi}) to specify this without altering the source file at all.  For
example:
@example
texi2dvi --texinfo=@@setcontentsaftertitlepage foo.texi
@end example


@node The Top Node
@section The `Top' Node and Master Menu
@cindex Top node
@cindex Node, `Top'

The `Top' node is the node in which a reader enters an Info manual.
As such, it should begin with a brief description of the manual
(including the version number), and end with a master menu for the
whole manual.  Of course you should include any other general
information you feel a reader would find helpful.

@findex top
It is conventional and desirable to write an @code{@@top} sectioning
command line containing the title of the document immediately after
the @code{@@node Top} line (@pxref{makeinfo top command, , The
@code{@@top} Sectioning Command}).

The contents of the `Top' node should appear only in the online output;
none of it should appear in printed output, so enclose it between
@code{@@ifnottex} and @code{@@end ifnottex} commands.  (@TeX{} does not
print either an @code{@@node} line or a menu; they appear only in Info;
strictly speaking, you are not required to enclose these parts between
@code{@@ifnottex} and @code{@@end ifnottex}, but it is simplest to do
so.  @xref{Conditionals, , Conditionally Visible Text}.)

@cindex Parts of a master menu

A @dfn{master menu} is a detailed main menu listing all the nodes in a
file.

A master menu is enclosed in @code{@@menu} and @code{@@end menu}
commands and does not appear in the printed document.

Generally, a master menu is divided into parts.

@itemize @bullet
@item
The first part contains the major nodes in the Texinfo file: the nodes
for the chapters, chapter-like sections, and the appendices.

@item
The second part contains nodes for the indices.

@item
@findex detailmenu
@cindex Detailed menu
The third and subsequent parts contain a listing of the other, lower
level nodes, often ordered by chapter.  This way, rather than go
through an intermediary menu, an inquirer can go directly to a
particular node when searching for specific information.  These menu
items are not required; add them if you think they are a
convenience.  If you do use them, put @code{@@detailmenu} before the
first one, and @code{@@end detailmenu} after the last; otherwise,
@code{makeinfo} will get confused.
@end itemize

Each section in the menu can be introduced by a descriptive line.  So
long as the line does not begin with an asterisk, it will not be
treated as a menu entry.  (@xref{Writing a Menu}, for more
information.)

For example, the master menu for this manual looks like the following

@subsection @code{@@documentdescription}: Summary Text
@cindex Document description
@cindex Description of document

@cindex <meta> HTML tag, and document description
@findex documentdescription

When producing HTML output for a document, @command{makeinfo} writes a
@samp{<meta>} element in the @samp{<head>} to give some idea of the
content of the document.  By default, this @dfn{description} is the title
of the document, taken from the @code{@@settitle} command
(@pxref{settitle}).  To change this, use the @code{@@documentdescription}
environment, as in:

@example
@@documentdescription
descriptive text.
@@end documentdescription
@end example

@noindent
This will produce the following output in the @samp{<head>} of the HTML:

@example
<meta name=description content="descriptive text.">
@end example

@code{@@documentdescription} must be specified before the first node of
the document.


@node setchapternewpage
@subsection @code{@@setchapternewpage}:
@cindex Starting chapters
@cindex Pages, starting odd
@findex setchapternewpage

In an officially bound book, text is usually printed on both sides of
the paper, chapters start on right-hand pages, and right-hand pages have
odd numbers.  But in short reports, text often is printed only on one
side of the paper.  Also in short reports, chapters sometimes do not
start on new pages, but are printed on the same page as the end of the
preceding chapter, after a small amount of vertical whitespace.

You can use the @code{@@setchapternewpage} command with various
arguments to specify how @TeX{} should start chapters and whether it
should format headers for printing on one or both sides of the paper
(single-sided or double-sided printing).

Write the @code{@@setchapternewpage} command at the beginning of a
line followed by its argument.

For example, you would write the following to cause each chapter to
start on a fresh odd-numbered page:

@example
@@setchapternewpage odd
@end example

You can specify one of three alternatives with the
@code{@@setchapternewpage} command:

@table @asis

@item @code{@@setchapternewpage off}
Cause @TeX{} to typeset a new chapter on the same page as the last
chapter, after skipping some vertical whitespace.  Also, cause @TeX{} to
format page headers for single-sided printing.

@item @code{@@setchapternewpage on}
Cause @TeX{} to start new chapters on new pages and to format page
headers for single-sided printing.  This is the form most often used for
short reports or personal printing. This is the default.

@item @code{@@setchapternewpage odd}
Cause @TeX{} to start new chapters on new, odd-numbered pages
(right-handed pages) and to typeset for double-sided printing.  This is
the form most often used for books and manuals.
@end table

Texinfo does not have an @code{@@setchapternewpage even} command,
because there is no printing tradition of starting chapters or books on
an even-numbered page.

If you don't like the default headers that @code{@@setchapternewpage}
sets, you can explicit control them with the @code{@@headings} command.
@xref{headings on off, , The @code{@@headings} Command}.

At the beginning of a manual or book, pages are not numbered---for
example, the title and copyright pages of a book are not numbered.  By
convention, table of contents and frontmatter pages are numbered with
roman numerals and not in sequence with the rest of the document.

Since an Info file does not have pages, the @code{@@setchapternewpage}
command has no effect on it.

We recommend not including any @code{@@setchapternewpage} command in
your manual sources at all, since the desired output is not intrinsic to
the document.  For a particular hard copy run, if you don't want the
default option (no blank pages, same headers on all pages) use the
@option{--texinfo} option to @command{texi2dvi} to specify the output
you want.


@node paragraphindent
@subsection @code{@@paragraphindent}: Paragraph Indenting
@cindex Indenting paragraphs, control of
@cindex Paragraph indentation control
@findex paragraphindent

The Texinfo processors may insert whitespace at the beginning of the
first line of each paragraph, thereby indenting that paragraph.  You can
use the @code{@@paragraphindent} command to specify this indentation.
Write an @code{@@paragraphindent} command at the beginning of a line
followed by either @samp{asis} or a number:

@example
@@paragraphindent @var{indent}
@end example

The indentation is according to the value of @var{indent}:

@table @asis
@item @code{asis}
Do not change the existing indentation (not implemented in @TeX{}).

@item @code{none}
@itemx 0
Omit all indentation.

@item @var{n}
Indent by @var{n} space characters in Info output, by @var{n} ems in
@TeX{}.

@end table

The default value of @var{indent} is 3.  @code{@@paragraphindent} is
ignored for HTML output.

It is best to write the @code{@@paragraphindent} command before the
end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file, so the region
formatting commands indent paragraphs as specified.  @xref{Start of
Header}.

A peculiarity of the @code{texinfo-format-buffer} and
@code{texinfo-format-region} commands is that they do not indent (nor
fill) paragraphs that contain @code{@@w} or @code{@@*} commands.


@node firstparagraphindent
@subsection @code{@@firstparagraphindent}: Indenting After Headings
@cindex First paragraph, suppressing indentation of
@cindex Suppressing first paragraph indentation
@cindex Preventing first paragraph indentation
@cindex Indenting, suppressing of first paragraph
@cindex Headings, indentation after
@findex firstparagraphindent

As you can see in the present manual, the first paragraph in any
section is not indented by default.  Typographically, indentation is a
paragraph separator, which means that it is unnecessary when a new
section begins.  This indentation is controlled with the
@code{@@firstparagraphindent} command:

@example
@@firstparagraphindent @var{word}
@end example

The first paragraph after a heading is indented according to the value
of @var{word}:

@table @asis
@item @code{none}
Prevents the first paragraph from being indented (default).
This option is ignored by @command{makeinfo} if
@code{@@paragraphindent asis} is in effect.

@item @code{insert}
Include normal paragraph indentation.  This respects the paragraph
indentation set by a @code{@@paragraphindent} command
(@pxref{paragraphindent}).
@end table

For HTML and XML output, the @code{@@firstparagraphindent} setting is
ignored.

It is best to write the @code{@@firstparagraphindent} command before the
end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file, so the region
formatting commands indent paragraphs as specified.  @xref{Start of
Header}.


@node exampleindent
@subsection @code{@@exampleindent}: Environment Indenting
@cindex Indenting environments
@cindex Environment indentation
@cindex Example indentation
@findex exampleindent

The Texinfo processors indent each line of @code{@@example} and similar
environments.  You can use the @code{@@exampleindent} command to specify
this indentation.  Write an @code{@@exampleindent} command at the
beginning of a line followed by either @samp{asis} or a number:

@example
@@exampleindent @var{indent}
@end example

The indentation is according to the value of @var{indent}:

@table @asis
@item @code{asis}
Do not change the existing indentation (not implemented in @TeX{}).

@item 0
Omit all indentation.

@item @var{n}
Indent environments by @var{n} space characters in Info output, by
@var{n} ems in @TeX{}.

@end table

The default value of @var{indent} is 5 spaces in Info, and 0.4@dmn{in}
in @TeX{}, which is somewhat less.  (The reduction is to help @TeX{}
fit more characters onto physical lines.)

It is best to write the @code{@@exampleindent} command before the
end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file, so the region
formatting commands indent paragraphs as specified.  @xref{Start of
Header}.


@node Software Copying Permissions
@section Software Copying Permissions
@cindex Software copying permissions
@cindex Copying software
@cindex Distribution
@cindex License agreement

If the Texinfo file has a section containing the ``General Public
License'' and the distribution information and a warranty disclaimer for
the software that is documented, we recommend placing this right after
the `Top' node.  The General Public License is very important to Project
GNU software.  It ensures that you and others will continue to have a
right to use and share the software.

The copying and distribution information and the disclaimer are followed
by an introduction or else by the first chapter of the manual.

@cindex Introduction, as part of file
Although an introduction is not a required part of a Texinfo file, it
is very helpful.  Ideally, it should state clearly and concisely what
the file is about and who would be interested in reading it.  In
general, an introduction would follow the licensing and distribution
information, although sometimes people put it earlier in the document.


@node Ending a File
@chapter Ending a Texinfo File
@cindex Ending a Texinfo file
@cindex Texinfo file ending
@cindex File ending
@findex bye

The end of a Texinfo file should include commands to create indices,
and the @code{@@bye} command to mark the last line to be processed.

For example:

@example
@@node Index
@@unnumbered Index

@@printindex cp

@@bye
@end example

@menu

@end menu


@node Printing Indices & Menus
@section Printing Indices and Menus
@cindex Printing an index
@cindex Indices, printing and menus
@cindex Generating menus with indices
@cindex Menus generated with indices

To print an index means to include it as part of a manual or Info file.
This does not happen automatically just because you use @code{@@cindex}
or other index-entry generating commands in the Texinfo file; those just
cause the raw data for the index to be accumulated.  To generate an
index, you must include the @code{@@printindex} command at the place in
the document where you want the index to appear.  Also, as part of the
process of creating a printed manual, you must run a program called
@code{texindex} (@pxref{Hardcopy}) to sort the raw data to produce a
sorted index file.  The sorted index file is what is actually used to
print the index.

Texinfo offers six separate types of predefined index, which suffice
in most cases.  @xref{Indices}, for information on this, as well
defining your own new indices, combining indices, and, most
importantly advice on writing the actual index entries.  This section
focuses on printing indices, which is done with the
@code{@@printindex} command.

@findex printindex
@code{@@printindex} takes one argument, a two-letter index
abbreviation.  It reads the corresponding sorted index file (for
printed output), and formats it appropriately into an index.

The @code{@@printindex} command does not generate a chapter heading
for the index, since different manuals have different needs.
Consequently, you should precede the @code{@@printindex} command with
a suitable section or chapter command (usually @code{@@appendix} or
@code{@@unnumbered}) to supply the chapter heading and put the index
into the table of contents.  Precede the chapter heading with an
@code{@@node} line as usual.

For example:

@smallexample
@group
@@node Variable Index
@@unnumbered Variable Index

@@printindex vr
@end group

@group
@@node Concept Index
@@unnumbered Concept Index

@@printindex cp
@end group
@end smallexample

If you have more than one index, we recommend placing the concept index last.

@itemize
@item
In printed output, @code{@@printindex} produces a traditional
two-column index, with dot leaders between the index terms and page
numbers.

@item
In Info output, @code{@@printindex} produces a special menu containing
the line number of the entry, relative to the start of the node.  Info
readers can use this to go to the exact line of an entry, not just the
containing node.  (Older Info readers will just go to the node.)
Here's an example:

@smallexample
* First index entry:   Top.   (line  7)
@end smallexample

@noindent The actual number of spaces is variable, to right-justify
the line number; it's been reduced here to make the line fit in the
printed manual.

@item
In plain text output, @code{@@printindex} produces the same menu, but
the line numbers are relative to the start of the file, since that's
more convenient for that format.

@item
In HTML and Docbook output, @code{@@printindex} produces links
to the index entries.

@item
In XML output, it simply records the index to be printed.
@end itemize

It's not possible to generate an index when writing to standard
output; @command{makeinfo} generates a warning in this case.


@node File End
@section @code{@@bye} File Ending
@findex bye

An @code{@@bye} command terminates Texinfo processing.  None of the
formatters read anything following @code{@@bye}.  The @code{@@bye}
command should be on a line by itself.

If you wish, you may follow the @code{@@bye} line with notes. These
notes will not be formatted and will not appear in either Info or a
printed manual; it is as if text after @code{@@bye} were within
@code{@@ignore} @dots{} @code{@@end ignore}.  Also, you may follow the
@code{@@bye} line with a local variables list for Emacs.
@xref{Compile-Command, , Using Local Variables and the Compile Command},

@node Structuring
@chapter Chapter Structuring
@cindex Chapter structuring
@cindex Structuring of chapters

The @dfn{chapter structuring} commands divide a document into a hierarchy of
chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.  These commands
generate large headings; they also provide information for the table
of contents of a printed manual (@pxref{Contents, , Generating a Table
of Contents}).@refill

The chapter structuring commands do not create an Info node structure,
so normally you should put an @code{@@node} command immediately before
each chapter structuring command (@pxref{Nodes}).  The only time you
are likely to use the chapter structuring commands without using the
node structuring commands is if you are writing a document that
contains no cross references and will never be transformed into Info
format.@refill

It is unlikely that you will ever write a Texinfo file that is
intended only as an Info file and not as a printable document.  If you
do, you might still use chapter structuring commands to create a
heading at the top of each node---but you don't need to.@refill

@node Tree Structuring
@section Tree Structure of Sections
@cindex Tree structuring

A Texinfo file is usually structured like a book with chapters,
sections, subsections, and the like.  This structure can be visualized
as a tree (or rather as an upside-down tree) with the root at the top
and the levels corresponding to chapters, sections, subsection, and
subsubsections.@refill

Here is a diagram that shows a Texinfo file with three chapters,
each of which has two sections.@refill

@example
@group
                         Top
                          |

@end group
@end example

In a Texinfo file that has this structure, the beginning of Chapter 2
looks like this:@refill

@example
@group
@@node    Chapter 2,  Chapter 3, Chapter 1, top
@@chapter Chapter 2
@end group
@end example

The chapter structuring commands are described in the sections that
follow; the @code{@@node} and @code{@@menu} commands are described in
following chapters. (@xref{Nodes}, and see @ref{Menus}.)@refill


@node Structuring Command Types
@section Structuring Command Types

The chapter structuring commands fall into four groups or series, each
of which contains structuring commands corresponding to the
hierarchical levels of chapters, sections, subsections, and
subsubsections.@refill

The four groups are the @code{@@chapter} series, the
@code{@@unnumbered} series, the @code{@@appendix} series, and the
@code{@@heading} series.@refill

Each command produces titles that have a different appearance on the
printed page or Info file; only some of the commands produce
titles that are listed in the table of contents of a printed book or
manual.@refill

@itemize @bullet
@item
The @code{@@chapter} and @code{@@appendix} series of commands produce
numbered or lettered entries both in the body of a printed work and in
its table of contents.@refill

@item
The @code{@@unnumbered} series of commands produce unnumbered entries
both in the body of a printed work and in its table of contents.  The
@code{@@top} command, which has a special use, is a member of this
series (@pxref{makeinfo top, , @code{@@top}}).  An @code{@@unnumbered}
section should be associated with a node and be a normal part of the
document structure.

@item
The @code{@@heading} series of commands produce simple unnumbered
headings that do not appear in a table of contents, are not associated
with nodes, and cannot be cross-referenced.  The heading commands
never start a new page.

@item
The @code{@@majorheading} command is similar to @code{@@chapheading},
except that it generates a larger vertical whitespace before the
heading.

@item
When an @code{@@setchapternewpage} command says to do so, the
@code{@@chapter}, @code{@@unnumbered}, and @code{@@appendix} commands
start new pages in the printed manual; the @code{@@heading} commands
do not.@refill
@end itemize

Here are the four groups of chapter structuring commands:

@tex
{\globaldefs = 1 \smallfonts}
@end tex

@multitable @columnfractions .19 .30 .29 .22
@item                        @tab                              @tab                       @tab No new page
@item @i{Numbered}           @tab @i{Unnumbered}               @tab @i{Lettered/numbered} @tab @i{Unnumbered}

@end multitable
@tex
{\globaldefs = 1 \textfonts}
@end tex


@node makeinfo top
@section @code{@@top}

The @code{@@top} command is a special sectioning command that you use
only after an @samp{@@node Top} line at the beginning of a Texinfo
file.  The @code{@@top} command tells the @code{makeinfo} formatter
which node is the `Top' node, so it can use it as the root of the node
tree if your manual uses implicit node pointers.  It has the same
effect as @code{@@unnumbered} (@pxref{unnumbered & appendix, ,
@code{@@unnumbered} and @code{@@appendix}}).  For detailed
information, see @ref{makeinfo top command, , The @code{@@top}
Command}.

The @code{@@top} node and its menu (if any) is conventionally wrapped in
an @code{@@ifnottex} conditional so that it will appear only in Info and
HTML output, not @TeX{}.

@code{@@top} is ignored when raising or lowering sections
(@pxref{Raise/lower sections}).  That is, it is never lowered and
nothing can be raised to it.


@node chapter
@section @code{@@chapter}
@findex chapter

@code{@@chapter} identifies a chapter in the document.  Write the
command at the beginning of a line and follow it on the same line by
the title of the chapter.@refill

For example, this chapter in this manual is entitled ``Chapter
Structuring''; the @code{@@chapter} line looks like this:@refill

@example
@@chapter Chapter Structuring
@end example

In @TeX{}, the @code{@@chapter} command creates a chapter in the
document, specifying the chapter title.  The chapter is numbered
automatically.@refill

In Info, the @code{@@chapter} command causes the title to appear on a
line by itself, with a line of asterisks inserted underneath.  Thus,
in Info, the above example produces the following output:@refill

@example
Chapter Structuring
*******************
@end example

@findex centerchap
Texinfo also provides a command @code{@@centerchap}, which is analogous
to @code{@@unnumbered}, but centers its argument in the printed output.
This kind of stylistic choice is not usually offered by Texinfo.
@c but the Hacker's Dictionary wanted it ...


@node unnumbered & appendix
@section @code{@@unnumbered} and @code{@@appendix}
@findex unnumbered
@findex appendix

Use the @code{@@unnumbered} command to create a chapter that appears
in a printed manual without chapter numbers of any kind.  Use the
@code{@@appendix} command to create an appendix in a printed manual
that is labelled by letter (`A', `B', @dots{}) instead of by number.

Write an @code{@@appendix} or @code{@@unnumbered} command at the
beginning of a line and follow it on the same line by the title, as
you would if you were creating a chapter.


@node majorheading & chapheading
@section @code{@@majorheading}, @code{@@chapheading}
@findex majorheading
@findex chapheading

The @code{@@majorheading} and @code{@@chapheading} commands put
chapter-like headings in the body of a document.@refill

However, neither command causes @TeX{} to produce a numbered heading
or an entry in the table of contents; and neither command causes
@TeX{} to start a new page in a printed manual.@refill

In @TeX{}, an @code{@@majorheading} command generates a larger vertical
whitespace before the heading than an @code{@@chapheading} command but
is otherwise the same.

In Info,
the @code{@@majorheading} and
@code{@@chapheading} commands are equivalent to
@code{@@chapter}: the title is printed on a line by itself with a line
of asterisks underneath.  (@xref{chapter, , @code{@@chapter}}.)@refill


@node section
@section @code{@@section}
@findex section

A @code{@@section} command identifies a section within a chapter unit,
whether created with @code{@@chapter}, @code{@@unnumbered}, or
@code{@@appendix}, following the numbering scheme of the chapter-level
command.  Thus, within a @code{@@chapter} chapter numbered `1', the
section is numbered like `1.2'; within an @code{@@appendix}
``chapter'' labeled `A', the section is numbered like `A.2'; within an
@code{@@unnumbered} chapter, the section gets no number.

For example, this section is headed with an @code{@@section} command
and looks like this in the Texinfo file:

@example
@@section @@code@{@@@@section@}
@end example

To create a section, write the @code{@@section} command at the
beginning of a line and follow it on the same line by the section
title.  The output is underlined with @samp{=} in Info.

Thus,

@example
@@section This is a section
@end example

@noindent
might produce the following in Info:

@example
@group
5.7 This is a section
=====================
@end group
@end example


@node unnumberedsec appendixsec heading
@section @code{@@unnumberedsec}, @code{@@appendixsec}, @code{@@heading}
@findex unnumberedsec
@findex appendixsec
@findex heading

The @code{@@unnumberedsec}, @code{@@appendixsec}, and @code{@@heading}
commands are, respectively, the unnumbered, appendix-like, and
heading-like equivalents of the @code{@@section} command, as described
in the previous section.

@table @code
@item @@unnumberedsec
The @code{@@unnumberedsec} command may be used within an
unnumbered chapter or within a regular chapter or appendix to
provide an unnumbered section.@refill

@item @@appendixsec
@itemx @@appendixsection
@code{@@appendixsection} is a longer spelling of the
@code{@@appendixsec} command; the two are synonymous.@refill
@findex appendixsection

Conventionally, the @code{@@appendixsec} or @code{@@appendixsection}
command is used only within appendices.@refill

@item @@heading
You may use the @code{@@heading} command anywhere you wish for a
section-style heading that will not appear in the table of contents.@refill
@end table

@code{@@unnumberedsec} and @code{@@appendixsec} do not need to be used
in ordinary circumstances, because @code{@@section} may also be used
within @code{@@unnumbered} and @code{@@appendix} chapters; again, see
the previous section.


@node subsection
@section The @code{@@subsection} Command
@findex subsection

Subsections are to sections as sections are to chapters.
(@xref{section, , @code{@@section}}.)  In Info, subsection titles are
underlined with @samp{-}.  For example,

@example
@@subsection This is a subsection
@end example

@noindent
produces

@example
@group
1.2.3 This is a subsection
--------------------------
@end group
@end example

In a printed manual, subsections are listed in the table of contents
and are numbered three levels deep.@refill


@node unnumberedsubsec appendixsubsec subheading
@section The @code{@@subsection}-like Commands
@cindex Subsection-like commands
@findex unnumberedsubsec
@findex appendixsubsec
@findex subheading

The @code{@@unnumberedsubsec}, @code{@@appendixsubsec}, and
@code{@@subheading} commands are, respectively, the unnumbered,
appendix-like, and heading-like equivalents of the @code{@@subsection}
command.  (@xref{subsection, , @code{@@subsection}}.)

In Info, the @code{@@subsection}-like commands generate a title
underlined with hyphens.  In a printed manual, an @code{@@subheading}
command produces a heading like that of a subsection except that it is
not numbered and does not appear in the table of contents.  Similarly,
an @code{@@unnumberedsubsec} command produces an unnumbered heading like
that of a subsection and an @code{@@appendixsubsec} command produces a
subsection-like heading labelled with a letter and numbers; both of
these commands produce headings that appear in the table of
contents.

@code{@@unnumberedsubsec} and @code{@@appendixsubsec} do not need to
be used in ordinary circumstances, because @code{@@subsection} may
also be used within sections of @code{@@unnumbered} and
@code{@@appendix} chapters (@pxref{section,,@code{section}}).


@node subsubsection
@section The `subsub' Commands
@cindex Subsub commands

@item @@appendixsubsubsec
Conventionally, appendix commands are used only for appendices and are

exactly like ordinary subsubsections.@refill

@item @@subsubheading
The @code{@@subsubheading} command may be used anywhere that you need
a small heading that will not appear in the table of contents.  In
Info, subsubheadings look exactly like ordinary subsubsection
headings.@refill
@end table

@code{@@unnumberedsubsubsec} and @code{@@appendixsubsubsec} do not
need to be used in ordinary circumstances, because
@code{@@subsubsection} may also be used within subsections of
@code{@@unnumbered} and @code{@@appendix} chapters
(@pxref{section,,@code{section}}).


In Info, `subsub' titles are underlined with periods.
For example,@refill

@example

...............................
@end group
@end example


@node part
@section @code{@@part}: Groups of Chapters
@findex part
@cindex Part pages

The final sectioning command is @code{@@part}, to mark a @dfn{part} of
a manual, that is, a group of chapters or (more unusually) appendices.
This behaves quite differently from the other sectioning commands, to
fit with the way such parts are conventionally used in books.

No @code{@@node} command is associated with @code{@@part}.  Just write
the command on a line by itself, including the part title, at the
place in the document you want to mark off as starting that part.  For
example:

@example
@@part Part I:@* The beginning
@end example

As can be inferred from this example, no automatic numbering or
labeling of the @code{@@part} text is done.  The text is taken as-is.

Because parts are not associated with nodes, no general text can
follow the @code{@@part} line.  To produce the intended output, must
be followed by a chapter-level command (including its node).  Thus, to
continue the example:

@example
@@part Part I:@* The beginning

@@node Introduction
@@chapter Introduction
...
@end example

In the @TeX{} output, the @code{@@part} text is included in both the
normal and short tables of contents (@pxref{Contents}), without a page
number (since that is the normal convention).  In addition, a ``part
page'' is output in the body of the document, with just the
@code{@@part} text.  In the example above, the @code{@@*} causes a
line break on the part page (but is replaced with a space in the
tables of contents).  This part page is always forced to be on an odd
(right-hand) page, regardless of the chapter pagination
(@pxref{setchapternewpage,, @code{@@setchapternewpage}}).

In the HTML output, the @code{@@part} text is similarly included in
the tables of contents, and a heading is included in the main document
text, as part of the following chapter or appendix node.

In the XML and Docbook output, the @code{<part>} element includes all
the following chapters, up to the next @code{<part>}.  A @code{<part>}
containing chapters is also closed at an appendix.

In the Info and ASCII output, @code{@@part} has no effect.

@code{@@part} is ignored when raising or lowering sections (see next
section).  That is, it is never lowered and nothing can be raised to it.


@node Raise/lower sections
@section @code{@@raisesections} and @code{@@lowersections}
@findex raisesections
@findex lowersections
@cindex Raising and lowering sections
@cindex Lowering and raising sections
@cindex Sections, raising and lowering

The @code{@@raisesections} and @code{@@lowersections} commands
implicitly raise and lower the hierarchical level of following
chapters, sections and the other sectioning commands (excluding parts).

That is, the @code{@@raisesections} command changes sections to
chapters, subsections to sections, and so on.  Conversely, the
@code{@@lowersections} command changes chapters to sections, sections
to subsections, and so on.  Thus, an @code{@@lowersections} command
cancels an @code{@@raisesections} command, and vice versa.

@cindex Include files, and section levels
You can use @code{@@lowersections} to include text written as an outer
or standalone Texinfo file in another Texinfo file as an inner,
included file (@pxref{Include Files}).  Typical usage looks like this:

@example
@@lowersections
@@include somefile.texi
@@raisesections
@end example

@noindent (Without the @code{@@raisesections}, all the subsequent
sections in the document would be lowered.)

If the included file being lowered has a @code{@@top} node, you'll
need to conditionalize its inclusion with a flag (@pxref{set value}).

Another difficulty can arise with documents that use the (recommended)
feature of @command{makeinfo} for implicitly determining node
pointers.  Since @command{makeinfo} must assume a hierarchically
organized document to determine the pointers, you cannot just
arbitrarily sprinkle @code{@@raisesections} and @code{@@lowersections}
commands in the document.  The final result has to have menus that
take the raising and lowering into account.  Therefore, as a practical
matter, you generally only want to raise or lower large chunks,
usually in external files as shown above.

Repeated use of the commands continue to raise or lower the
hierarchical level a step at a time.  An attempt to raise above
`chapter' reproduces chapter commands; an attempt to lower below
`subsubsection' reproduces subsubsection commands.  Also, lowered
subsubsections and raised chapters will not work with
@command{makeinfo}'s feature of implicitly determining node pointers,
since the menu structure won't be correct.

Write each @code{@@raisesections} and @code{@@lowersections} command
on a line of its own.


@node Nodes
@chapter Nodes

@dfn{Nodes} are the primary segments of a Texinfo file.  They do not
in and of themselves impose a hierarchical or any other kind of
structure on a file.  Nodes contain @dfn{node pointers} that name
other nodes, and can contain @dfn{menus} which are lists of nodes.  In
Info, the movement commands can carry you to a pointed-to node or to a
node listed in a menu.

Node pointers and menus provide structure for Info files just as
chapters, sections, subsections, and the like, provide structure for
printed books.

Because node names are used in cross-references, it is not desirable
to casually change them.  Such name changes invalidate references from
other manuals, from mail archives, and so on.

@node Two Paths
@section Two Paths

The node and menu commands and the chapter structuring commands are
technically independent of each other:

@itemize @bullet
@item
In Info, node and menu commands provide structure.  The chapter
structuring commands generate headings with different kinds of
underlining---asterisks for chapters, hyphens for sections, and so on;
they do nothing else.@refill

@item
In @TeX{}, the chapter structuring commands generate chapter and section
numbers and tables of contents.  The node and menu commands provide
information for cross references; they do nothing else.@refill
@end itemize

You can use node pointers and menus to structure an Info file any way
you want; and you can write a Texinfo file so that its Info output has a
different structure than its printed output.  However, virtually all
Texinfo files are written such that the structure for the Info output
corresponds to the structure for the printed output.  It is neither
convenient nor understandable to the reader to do otherwise.@refill

Generally, printed output is structured in a tree-like hierarchy in
which the chapters are the major limbs from which the sections branch
out.  Similarly, node pointers and menus are organized to create a
matching structure in the Info output.@refill


@node Node Menu Illustration
@section Node and Menu Illustration

Here is a copy of the diagram shown earlier that illustrates a Texinfo
file with three chapters, each of which contains two sections.@refill

The ``root'' is at the top of the diagram and the ``leaves'' are at the
bottom.  This is how such a diagram is drawn conventionally; it
illustrates an upside-down tree.  For this reason, the root node is
called the `Top' node, and `Up' node pointers carry you closer to the
root.@refill

@example
@group

@end group
@end example

The fully-written command to start Chapter 2 would be this:

@example
@group
@@node     Chapter 2,  Chapter 3, Chapter 1, Top
@@comment  node-name,  next,      previous,  up
@end group
@end example

@noindent
This @code{@@node} line says that the name of this node is ``Chapter
2'', the name of the `Next' node is ``Chapter 3'', the name of the
`Previous' node is ``Chapter 1'', and the name of the `Up' node is
``Top''.  You can omit writing out these node names if your document is
hierarchically organized (@pxref{makeinfo Pointer Creation}), but the
pointer relationships still obtain.

@quotation Note
@strong{Please Note:} `Next' refers to the next node at the same
hierarchical level in the manual, not necessarily to the next node
within the Texinfo file.  In the Texinfo file, the subsequent node may
be at a lower level---a section-level node most often follows a
chapter-level node, for example.  `Next' and `Previous' refer to nodes
at the @emph{same} hierarchical level.  (The `Top' node contains the
exception to this rule.  Since the `Top' node is the only node at that
level, `Next' refers to the first following node, which is almost always
a chapter or chapter-level node.)@refill
@end quotation

To go to Sections 2.1 and 2.2 using Info, you need a menu inside Chapter
2.  (@xref{Menus}.)  You would write the menu just
before the beginning of Section 2.1, like this:@refill

@example
@group
   @@menu
   * Sect. 2.1::    Description of this section.
   * Sect. 2.2::
   @@end menu
@end group
@end example

Write the node for Sect. 2.1 like this:@refill

@example
@group
   @@node     Sect. 2.1, Sect. 2.2, Chapter 2, Chapter 2
   @@comment  node-name, next,      previous,  up
@end group
@end example

In Info format, the `Next' and `Previous' pointers of a node usually
lead to other nodes at the same level---from chapter to chapter or from
section to section (sometimes, as shown, the `Previous' pointer points
up); an `Up' pointer usually leads to a node at the level above (closer
to the `Top' node); and a `Menu' leads to nodes at a level below (closer
to `leaves').  (A cross reference can point to a node at any level;
see @ref{Cross References}.)@refill

Usually, an @code{@@node} command and a chapter structuring command are
used in sequence, along with indexing commands.  (You may follow the
@code{@@node} line with a comment line that reminds you which pointer is
which.)@refill

Here is the beginning of the chapter in this manual called ``Ending a
Texinfo File''.  This shows an @code{@@node} line followed by a comment
line, an @code{@@chapter} line, and then by indexing lines.@refill

@node node
@section The @code{@@node} Command

@cindex Node, defined
@findex node

A @dfn{node} is a segment of text that begins at an @code{@@node}
command and continues until the next @code{@@node} command.  The
definition of node is different from that for chapter or section.  A
chapter may contain sections and a section may contain subsections;
but a node cannot contain subnodes; the text of a node continues only
until the next @code{@@node} command in the file.  A node usually
contains only one chapter structuring command, the one that follows
the @code{@@node} line.  On the other hand, in printed output nodes
are used only for cross references, so a chapter or section may
contain any number of nodes.  Indeed, a chapter usually contains
several nodes, one for each section, subsection, and
subsubsection.

To specify a node, write an @code{@@node} command at the beginning of
a line, and follow it with up to four arguments, separated by commas,
on the rest of the same line.  The first argument is required; it is
the name of this node (for details of node names, @pxref{Node Line
Requirements}).  The subsequent arguments are the names of the `Next',
`Previous', and `Up' pointers, in that order, and may be omitted if
your Texinfo document is hierarchically organized (@pxref{makeinfo
Pointer Creation}).

@opindex accesskey@r{, in HTML output}
Whether the node pointers are specified implicitly or explicitly, the
HTML output from @command{makeinfo} for each node includes links to
the `Next', `Previous', and `Up' nodes.  The HTML also uses the
@code{accesskey} attribute with the values @samp{n}, @samp{p}, and
@samp{u} respectively.  This allows people using web browsers to
follow the nagivation using (typically) @kbd{M-@var{letter}}, e.g.,
@kbd{M-n} for the `Next' node, from anywhere within the node.

You may insert spaces before each name on the @code{@@node} line if
you wish; the spaces are ignored.  You must write the name of the node
and (if present) the names of the `Next', `Previous', and `Up'
pointers all on the same line.  Otherwise, the formatters fail.
(@inforef{Top, info, info}, for more information about nodes in Info.)

Usually, you write one of the chapter-structuring command lines
immediately after an @code{@@node} line---for example, an
@code{@@section} or @code{@@subsection} line.  (@xref{Structuring
Command Types}.)

@TeX{} uses @code{@@node} lines to identify the names to use for cross
references.  For this reason, you must write @code{@@node} lines in a
Texinfo file that you intend to format for printing, even if you do not
intend to format it for Info.  (Cross references, such as the one at the
end of this sentence, are made with @code{@@xref} and related commands;
see @ref{Cross References}.)

@node Node Names
@subsection Choosing Node and Pointer Names

@cindex Node names, choosing
The name of a node identifies the node (for details of node names,
@pxref{Node Line Requirements}).  The pointers enable you to reach
other nodes and consist simply of the names of those nodes.

Normally, a node's `Up' pointer contains the name of the node whose
menu mentions that node.  The node's `Next' pointer contains the name
of the node that follows the present node in that menu and its
`Previous' pointer contains the name of the node that precedes it in
that menu.  When a node's `Previous' node is the same as its `Up'
node, both node pointers name the same node.

Usually, the first node of a Texinfo file is the `Top' node, and its
`Up' and `Previous' pointers point to the @file{dir} file, which
contains the main menu for all of Info.

The `Top' node itself contains the main or master menu for the manual.
Also, it is helpful to include a brief description of the manual in the
`Top' node.  @xref{First Node}, for information on how to write the
first node of a Texinfo file.

Even when you explicitly specify all pointers, that does not mean you
can write the nodes in the Texinfo source file in an arbitrary order!
Because @TeX{} processes the file sequentially, irrespective of node
pointers, you must write the nodes in the order you wish them to appear
in the output.


@node Writing a Node
@subsection How to Write an @code{@@node} Line
@cindex Writing an @code{@@node} line
@cindex @code{@@node} line writing
@cindex Node line writing

The easiest way to write an @code{@@node} line is to write @code{@@node}
at the beginning of a line and then the name of the node, like
this:

@example
@@node @var{node-name}
@end example

If you are using GNU Emacs, you can use the update node commands
provided by Texinfo mode to insert the names of the pointers; or you
can leave the pointers out of the Texinfo file and let @code{makeinfo}
insert node pointers into the Info file it creates.  (@xref{Texinfo
Mode}, and @ref{makeinfo Pointer Creation}.)

Alternatively, you can insert the `Next', `Previous', and `Up'
pointers yourself.  If you do this, you may find it helpful to use the
Texinfo mode keyboard command @kbd{C-c C-c n}.  This command inserts
@samp{@@node} and a comment line listing the names of the pointers in
their proper order.  The comment line helps you keep track of which
arguments are for which pointers.  This comment line is especially useful
if you are not familiar with Texinfo.

The template for a fully-written-out node line with `Next', `Previous',
and `Up' pointers looks like this:

@example
@@node @var{node-name}, @var{next}, @var{previous}, @var{up}
@end example

The @var{node-name} argument must be present, but the others are
optional.  If you wish to specify some but not others, just insert
commas as needed, as in: @samp{@@node mynode,,,uppernode}.  However,
we recommend leaving off all the pointers and letting @code{makeinfo}
determine them, as described above.

If you wish, you can ignore @code{@@node} lines altogether in your first
draft and then use the @code{texinfo-insert-node-lines} command to
create @code{@@node} lines for you.  However, we do not recommend this
practice.  It is better to name the node itself at the same time that
you write a segment so you can easily make cross references.  A large
number of cross references are an especially important feature of a good
Info file.

After you have inserted an @code{@@node} line, you should immediately
write an @@-command for the chapter or section and insert its name.
Next (and this is important!), put in several index entries.  Usually,
you will find at least two and often as many as four or five ways of
referring to the node in the index.  Use them all.  This will make it
much easier for people to find the node.


@node Node Line Tips
@subsection @code{@@node} Line Tips

Here are three suggestions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Try to pick node names that are informative but short.@refill

In the Info file, the file name, node name, and pointer names are all
inserted on one line, which may run into the right edge of the window.
(This does not cause a problem with Info, but is ugly.)@refill

@item
Try to pick node names that differ from each other near the beginnings
of their names.  This way, it is easy to use automatic name completion in
Info.@refill

@item
By convention, node names are capitalized just as they would be for
section or chapter titles---initial and significant words are
capitalized; others are not.@refill
@end itemize


@node Node Line Requirements
@subsection @code{@@node} Line Requirements

@cindex Node line requirements
@cindex Restrictions on node names
Here are several requirements for @code{@@node} lines:

@itemize @bullet
@cindex Unique nodename requirement
@cindex Node name must be unique
@item
All the node names for a single Info file must be unique.

Duplicates confuse the Info movement commands.  This means, for
example, that if you end every chapter with a summary, you must name
each summary node differently.  You cannot just call each one
``Summary''.  You may, however, duplicate the titles of chapters, sections,
and the like.  Thus you can end each chapter in a book with a section
called ``Summary'', so long as the node names for those sections are all
different.

@item
A pointer name must be the name of a node.

The node to which a pointer points may come before or after the
node containing the pointer.

@item
@cindex @@-commands in nodename
@cindex Node name, should not contain @@-commands
@@-commands in node names are not allowed.  This includes punctuation
characters that are escaped with a @samp{@@}, such as @code{@@} and
@code{@{}, and accent commands such as @samp{@@'}.  Perhaps
this limitation will be removed some day.

@item
@cindex Colon in nodename
@cindex Comma in nodename
@cindex Parentheses in nodename
@cindex Period in nodename
@cindex Characters, invalid in node name
@cindex Invalid characters in node names
@cindex Node names, invalid characters in
Unfortunately, you cannot use periods, commas, colons or parentheses
within a node name; these confuse the Texinfo processors.  Perhaps
this limitation will be removed some day, too.

@need 700
For example, the following is a section title in this manual:

@smallexample
@@code@{@@@@unnumberedsec@}, @@code@{@@@@appendixsec@}, @@code@{@@@@heading@}
@end smallexample

@noindent
But the corresponding node name lacks the commas and the @@'s:

@smallexample
unnumberedsec appendixsec heading
@end smallexample

@cindex Case in node name
@item
Case is significant in node names.

@cindex White space in node name
@cindex Spaces in node name
Spaces before and after names on the @samp{@@node} line are ignored,
but spaces ``inside'' a name are significant.  For example:

@example
@@node  foo bar,
@@node foo bar ,
@@node  foo bar ,
@end example

@noindent all define the same node, @samp{foo bar}.  References to the
node should all use that name, without the leading or trailing spaces,
but with the internal spaces.
@end itemize


@node First Node
@subsection The First Node
@cindex Top node is first
@cindex First node

The first node of a Texinfo file is the @dfn{Top} node, except in an
included file (@pxref{Include Files}).  The Top node should contain a
short summary, copying permissions, and a master menu.  @xref{The Top
Node}, for more information on the Top node contents and examples.

Here is a description of the node pointers to be used in the Top node:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@cindex Up node of Top node
@cindex (dir) as Up node of Top node
The Top node (which must be named @samp{top} or @samp{Top}) should have
as its `Up' node the name of a node in another file, where there is a
menu that leads to this file.  Specify the file name in parentheses.

Usually, all Info files are installed in the same Info directory tree;
in this case, use @samp{(dir)} as the parent of the Top node; this is
short for @samp{(dir)top}, and specifies the Top node in the @file{dir}
file, which contains the main menu for the Info system as a whole.

@item
@cindex Prev node of Top node
The `Prev' node of the Top node should also be your @samp{(dir)} file.

@item
@cindex Next node of Top node
The `Next' node of the Top node should be the first chapter in your
document.

@end itemize

@xref{Installing an Info File}, for more information about installing
an Info file in the @file{info} directory.

It is usually best to leave the pointers off entirely and let the
tools implicitly define them, with this simple result:

@example
@@node Top
@end example


@node makeinfo top command
@subsection The @code{@@top} Sectioning Command
@findex top

A special sectioning command, @code{@@top} should be used after the
@code{@@node Top} line.  The @code{@@top} sectioning command tells
@code{makeinfo} that it marks the `Top' node in the file.  It provides
the information that @code{makeinfo} needs to insert node pointers
automatically.  Write the @code{@@top} command at the beginning of the
line immediately following the @code{@@node Top} line, followed by the
text of the title (on the same line).

In Info, the @code{@@top} sectioning command causes the title to appear
on a line by itself, with a line of asterisks inserted underneath, as
other sectioning commands do.

In @TeX{} and @code{texinfo-format-buffer}, the @code{@@top}
sectioning command is merely a synonym for @code{@@unnumbered}.
Neither of these formatters require an @code{@@top} command, and do
nothing special with it.  Indeed, it's conventional for the `Top' node
to be delimited by @code{@@ifnottex}, so that @TeX{} will not see it
(@pxref{Conditionals}).

Thus, in practice, a Top node usually looks like this:

@example
@@ifnottex
@@node Top
@@top @var{your-manual-title}

@var{very-high-level-summary}
@@end ifnottex

@end example


@node makeinfo Pointer Creation
@section Creating Pointers with @code{makeinfo}
@cindex Creating pointers with @code{makeinfo}
@cindex Pointer creation with @code{makeinfo}
@cindex Automatic pointer creation with @code{makeinfo}

The @code{makeinfo} program has a feature for automatically
determining node pointers for a hierarchically organized document.  We
highly recommend using it.

When you take advantage of this feature, you do not need to write the
`Next', `Previous', and `Up' pointers after the name of a node.
However, you must write a sectioning command, such as @code{@@chapter}
or @code{@@section}, on the line immediately following each truncated
@code{@@node} line (except that comment lines may intervene).

In addition, you must follow the `Top' @code{@@node} line with a line
beginning with @code{@@top} to mark the `Top' node in the
file.  @xref{makeinfo top, , @code{@@top}}.

Finally, you must write the name of each node (except for the `Top'
node) in a menu that is one or more hierarchical levels above the
node's hierarchical level.

@cindex Detail menu
@findex detailmenu
If you use a detailed menu in your master menu (@pxref{Master Menu
Parts}), mark it with the @code{@@detailmenu @@dots@{@} @@end
detailmenu} environment, or @command{makeinfo} will get confused,
typically about the last and/or first node in the document.

This implicit node pointer creation feature in @code{makeinfo}
relieves you from the need to update menus and pointers manually or
with Texinfo mode commands.  (@xref{Updating Nodes and Menus}.)

In most cases, you will want to take advantage of this feature and not
redundantly specify node pointers.  However, Texinfo documents are not
required to be organized hierarchically or in fact to contain
sectioning commands at all (for example, if you never intend the
document to be printed).  The special procedure for handling the short
text before a menu (@pxref{Menus}) also disables this
feature, for that group of nodes.  In those cases, you will need to
explicitly specify all pointers.

@node anchor
@section @code{@@anchor}: Defining Arbitrary Cross-reference Targets

@findex anchor
@cindex Anchors
@cindex Cross-reference targets, arbitrary
@cindex Targets for cross-references, arbitrary

An @dfn{anchor} is a position in your document, labeled so that
cross-references can refer to it, just as they can to nodes.  You create
an anchor with the @code{@@anchor} command, and give the label as a
normal brace-delimited argument.  For example:

@example
This marks the @@anchor@{x-spot@}spot.
@dots{}
@@xref@{x-spot,,the spot@}.
@end example

@noindent produces:

@example
This marks the spot.
@dots{}
See [the spot], page 1.
@end example

As you can see, the @code{@@anchor} command itself produces no output.
This example defines an anchor `x-spot' just before the word `spot'.
You can refer to it later with an @code{@@xref} or other cross-reference
command, as shown.  @xref{Cross References}, for details on the
cross-reference commands.

It is best to put @code{@@anchor} commands just before the position you
wish to refer to; that way, the reader's eye is led on to the correct
text when they jump to the anchor.  You can put the @code{@@anchor}
command on a line by itself if that helps readability of the source.
Whitespace (including newlines) is ignored after @code{@@anchor}.

Anchor names and node names may not conflict.  Anchors and nodes are
given similar treatment in some ways; for example, the @code{goto-node}
command in standalone Info takes either an anchor name or a node name as
an argument.  (@xref{goto-node,,,info-stnd,GNU Info}.)

Also like node names, anchor names cannot include some characters
(@pxref{Node Line Requirements}).


@node Menus
@chapter Menus
@cindex Menus
@findex menu

@dfn{Menus} contain pointers to subordinate nodes.  In online output,
you use menus to go to such nodes.  Menus have no effect in printed
manuals and do not appear in them.

A node with a menu should not contain much text.  If you find yourself
writing a lot of text before a menu, we generally recommend moving
most of the text into a new subnode---all but a paragraph or two.
Otherwise, it is easy for readers to miss the menu.

@menu

* Writing a Menu::              What is a menu?

* Menu Example::                Two and three part menu entries.
* Other Info Files::            How to refer to a different Info file.
@end menu


@node Menu Location
@section Menu Location
@cindex Menu location
@cindex Location of menus

There may be at most one menu in a node.  A menu is conventionally
located at the end of a node, without any regular text or additional
commands between the @code{@@end menu} and the beginning of the next
node.  

@cindex Info format, and menus
This convention is useful, since a reader who uses the menu could
easily miss any such text.  Also, any such post-menu text will be
considered part of the menu in Info output (which has no marker for
the end of a menu).  Thus, a line beginning with @samp{* } will likely
be incorrectly handled.

@cindex Hierarchical documents, and menus
Technically, menus can carry you to any node, regardless of the
structure of the document; even to nodes in a different Info file.
However, we do not recommend making use of this, because it is hard
for readers to follow.  Also, the @command{makeinfo} implicit pointer
creation feature (@pxref{makeinfo Pointer Creation}) and GNU Emacs
Texinfo mode updating commands work only to create menus of
subordinate nodes in a hierarchically structured document.  It is much
better to use cross references to refer to arbitrary nodes.

In the past, we recommended using a @samp{@@heading} command within an
@code{@@ifinfo} conditional instead of the normal sectioning commands
after a very short node with a menu.  This had the advantage of making
the printed output look better, because there was no very short text
between two headings on the page.  But this also does not work with
@command{makeinfo}'s implicit pointer creation, and it also makes the
XML output incorrect, since it does not reflect the true document
structure.  So, regrettably, we can no longer recommend this.

A menu consists of an @code{@@menu} command on a line by itself

@@end menu

@end example

In a menu, every line that begins with an @w{@samp{* }} is a @dfn{menu
entry}.  (Note the space after the asterisk.)  A line that does not
start with an @w{@samp{* }} may also appear in a menu.  Such a line is
not a menu entry but is a menu comment line that appears in the Info
file.  In the example above, the line @samp{Larger Units of Text} is a
menu comment line; the two lines starting with @w{@samp{* }} are menu
@cindex Spaces, in menus
entries.  Space characters in a menu are preserved as-is; this allows
you to format the menu as you wish.

@opindex accesskey@r{, in HTML output}
In the HTML output from @command{makeinfo}, the @code{accesskey}
attribute is used with the values @samp{1}@dots{}@samp{9} for the
first nine entries.  This allows people using web browsers to follow
the first menu entries using (typically) @kbd{M-@var{digit}}, e.g.,
@kbd{M-1} for the first entry.


@node Menu Parts
@section The Parts of a Menu
@cindex Parts of a menu
@cindex Menu parts
@cindex @code{@@menu} parts

A menu entry has three parts, only the second of which is required:

@enumerate
@item
The menu entry name (optional).

@item
The name of the node (required).

@item
A description of the item (optional).
@end enumerate

The template for a generic menu entry looks like this (but see the
next section for one more possibility):

@example
* @var{menu-entry-name}: @var{node-name}.   @var{description}
@end example

Follow the menu entry name with a single colon and follow the node name
with tab, comma, newline, or the two characters period and space
(@samp{. }).

In Info, a user selects a node with the @kbd{m} (@code{Info-menu})
command.  The menu entry name is what the user types after the @kbd{m}
command.

The third part of a menu entry is a descriptive phrase or sentence.
Menu entry names and node names are often short; the description
explains to the reader what the node is about.  A useful description
complements the node name rather than repeats it.  The description,
which is optional, can spread over two or more lines; if it does, some
authors prefer to indent the second line while others prefer to align it
with the first (and all others).  It's up to you.


@node Less Cluttered Menu Entry
@section Less Cluttered Menu Entry
@cindex Two part menu entry
@cindex Double-colon menu entries
@cindex Menu entries with two colons
@cindex Less cluttered menu entry
@cindex Uncluttered menu entry

When the menu entry name and node name are the same, you can write
the name immediately after the asterisk and space at the beginning of
the line and follow the name with two colons.

@need 800
For example, write

@example
* Name::                        @var{description}
@end example

@need 800
@noindent
instead of

@example
* Name: Name.                   @var{description}
@end example

You should indeed use the node name for the menu entry name whenever
possible, since it reduces visual clutter in the menu.


@node Menu Example
@section A Menu Example

@cindex Example menu

A menu looks like this in Texinfo:@refill

@example

This produces:

@example
@group

This produces:

* Multiples: Buffers.           Multiple buffers; editing
                                 several files at once.
@end group
@end example

In this example, the menu has two entries.  @samp{Files} is both a menu
entry name and the name of the node referred to by that name.
@samp{Multiples} is the menu entry name; it refers to the node named
@samp{Buffers}. The line @samp{Larger Units of Text} is a comment; it
appears in the menu, but is not an entry.@refill

Since no file name is specified with either @samp{Files} or
@samp{Buffers}, they must be the names of nodes in the same Info file
(@pxref{Other Info Files, , Referring to Other Info Files}).@refill

@node Other Info Files
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Referring to Other Info Files
@cindex Referring to other Info files
@cindex Nodes in other Info files
@cindex Other Info files' nodes
@cindex Going to other Info files' nodes
@cindex Info; other files' nodes

You can create a menu entry that enables a reader in Info to go to a
node in another Info file by writing the file name in parentheses just
before the node name.  In this case, you should use the three-part menu
entry format, which saves the reader from having to type the file
name.@refill

@need 800
The format looks like this:@refill

@example
@group
@@menu
* @var{first-entry-name}:(@var{filename})@var{nodename}.     @var{description}
* @var{second-entry-name}:(@var{filename})@var{second-node}. @var{description}
@@end menu
@end group
@end example

For example, to refer directly to the @samp{Outlining} and
@samp{Rebinding} nodes in the @cite{Emacs Manual}, you would write a
menu like this:@refill

@example
@group
@@menu
* Outlining: (emacs)Outline Mode. The major mode for
                                 editing outlines.

                                 meaning of a key.
@@end menu
@end group
@end example

If you do not list the node name, but only name the file, then Info
presumes that you are referring to the `Top' node.@refill

The @file{dir} file that contains the main menu for Info has menu
entries that list only file names.  These take you directly to the `Top'
nodes of each Info document.  (@xref{Installing an Info File}.)

@need 700
For example:

@example
@group
* Info: (info).         Documentation browsing system.
* Emacs: (emacs).       The extensible, self-documenting
                       text editor.
@end group
@end example

@noindent
(The @file{dir} top level directory for the Info system is an Info file,
not a Texinfo file, but a menu entry looks the same in both types of
file.)@refill

The GNU Emacs Texinfo mode menu updating commands only work with nodes
within the current buffer, so you cannot use them to create menus that
refer to other files.  You must write such menus by hand.

@node References
@section What References Are For

Often, but not always, a printed document should be designed so that
it can be read sequentially.  People tire of flipping back and forth
to find information that should be presented to them as they need
it.@refill

However, in any document, some information will be too detailed for
the current context, or incidental to it; use cross references to
provide access to such information.  Also, an online help system or a
reference manual is not like a novel; few read such documents in
sequence from beginning to end.  Instead, people look up what they
need.  For this reason, such creations should contain many cross
references to help readers find other information that they may not
have read.@refill

In a printed manual, a cross reference results in a page reference,
unless it is to another manual altogether, in which case the cross
reference names that manual.@refill

In Info, a cross reference results in an entry that you can follow
using the Info @samp{f} command.  (@inforef{Help-Xref, Following
cross-references, info}.)

The various cross reference commands use nodes (or anchors,
@pxref{anchor,,@code{@@anchor}}) to define cross reference locations.
This is evident in Info, in which a cross reference takes you to the
specified location.  @TeX{} also uses nodes to define cross reference
locations, but the action is less obvious.  When @TeX{} generates a DVI
file, it records each node's page number and uses the page numbers in making
references.  Thus, if you are writing a manual that will only be
printed, and will not be used online, you must nonetheless write
@code{@@node} lines to name the places to which you make cross
references.@refill

@need 800

@section Different Cross Reference Commands

or an Info cross-reference saying @samp{*Note @var{name}: @var{node}.}.

@item @@ref

@code{@@xref} for Info; produces just the reference in the printed
manual without a preceding `See'.@refill

@item @@pxref
Used within parentheses to make a reference that suits both an Info
file and a printed book.  Starts with a lower case `see' within the
printed manual. (@samp{p} is for `parenthesis'.)@refill

@item @@inforef
Used to make a reference to an Info file for which there is no printed
manual.@refill
@end table

(The @code{@@cite} command is used to make references to books and

no node to which to point.   @xref{cite, , @code{@@cite}}.)@refill

@node Cross Reference Parts
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Parts of a Cross Reference
@cindex Cross reference parts
@cindex Parts of a cross reference

A cross reference command requires only one argument, which is the
name of the node to which it refers.  But a cross reference command
may contain up to four additional arguments.  By using these
arguments, you can provide a cross reference name for Info, a topic
description or section title for the printed output, the name of a
different Info file, and the name of a different printed
manual.@refill

Here is a simple cross reference example:@refill

@example
@@xref@{Node name@}.
@end example

@noindent
which produces

@example
*Note Node name::.
@end example

@noindent
and

@quotation
See Section @var{nnn} [Node name], page @var{ppp}.
@end quotation

@need 700
Here is an example of a full five-part cross reference:@refill

@example
@group
@@xref@{Node name, Cross Reference Name, Particular Topic,
info-file-name, A Printed Manual@}, for details.
@end group
@end example

@noindent
which produces

@example
*Note Cross Reference Name: (info-file-name)Node name,
for details.
@end example

@noindent
in Info and

@quotation
See section ``Particular Topic'' in @i{A Printed Manual}, for details.
@end quotation

@noindent
in a printed book.

The five possible arguments for a cross reference are:@refill

@enumerate
@item
The node or anchor name (required).  This is the location to which the
cross reference takes you.  In a printed document, the location of the
node provides the page reference only for references within the same
document.@refill

@item
The cross reference name for the Info reference, if it is to be
different from the node name or the topic description.  If you
include this argument, it becomes the first part of the cross reference.
It is usually omitted; then the topic description (third argument) is
used if it was specified; if that was omitted as well, the node name
is used.

@item
A topic description or section name.  Often, this is the title of the
section.  This is used as the name of the reference in the printed
manual.  If omitted, the node name is used.@refill

@item
The name of the Info file in which the reference is located, if it is
different from the current file.  You need not include any @samp{.info}
suffix on the file name, since Info readers try appending it
automatically.

@item
The name of a printed manual from a different Texinfo file.@refill
@end enumerate

The template for a full five argument cross reference looks like
this:@refill

@example
@group
@@xref@{@var{node-name}, @var{cross-reference-name}, @var{title-or-topic},
@var{info-file-name}, @var{printed-manual-title}@}.
@end group
@end example

Cross references with one, two, three, four, and five arguments are
described separately following the description of @code{@@xref}.@refill

Write a node name in a cross reference in exactly the same way as in
the @code{@@node} line, including the same capitalization; otherwise, the
formatters may not find the reference.@refill

You can write cross reference commands within a paragraph, but note
how Info and @TeX{} format the output of each of the various commands:
write @code{@@xref} at the beginning of a sentence; write
@code{@@pxref} only within parentheses, and so on.@refill

@node xref
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section @code{@@xref}
@findex xref
@cindex Cross references using @code{@@xref}
@cindex References using @code{@@xref}

The @code{@@xref} command generates a cross reference for the
beginning of a sentence.  The Info formatting commands convert it into
an Info cross reference, which the Info @samp{f} command can use to
bring you directly to another node.  The @TeX{} typesetting commands
convert it into a page reference, or a reference to another book or
manual.@refill

@node Reference Syntax
@subsection What a Reference Looks Like and Requires

Most often, an Info cross reference looks like this:@refill

@example
*Note @var{node-name}::.
@end example

@noindent
or like this

@example
*Note @var{cross-reference-name}: @var{node-name}.
@end example

@noindent
In @TeX{}, a cross reference looks like this:

@quotation
See Section @var{section-number} [@var{node-name}], page @var{page}.
@end quotation

@noindent
or like this

@quotation
See Section @var{section-number} [@var{title-or-topic}], page @var{page}.
@end quotation

The @code{@@xref} command does not generate a period or comma to end
the cross reference in either the Info file or the printed output.
You must write that period or comma yourself; otherwise, Info will not
recognize the end of the reference.  (The @code{@@pxref} command works
differently.  @xref{pxref, , @code{@@pxref}}.)@refill

@quotation Caution
A period or comma @strong{must} follow the closing
brace of an @code{@@xref}.  It is required to terminate the cross
reference.  This period or comma will appear in the output, both in
the Info file and in the printed manual.@refill
@end quotation

@code{@@xref} must refer to an Info node by name.  Use @code{@@node}
to define the node (@pxref{Writing a Node}).@refill

@code{@@xref} is followed by several arguments inside braces, separated by
commas.  Whitespace before and after these commas is ignored.@refill

A cross reference requires only the name of a node; but it may contain
up to four additional arguments.  Each of these variations produces a
cross reference that looks somewhat different.@refill

@quotation Note
Commas separate arguments in a cross reference;
avoid including them in the title or other part lest the formatters
mistake them for separators.@refill
@end quotation

@node One Argument
@subsection @code{@@xref} with One Argument

The simplest form of @code{@@xref} takes one argument, the name of
another node in the same Info file.    The Info formatters produce
output that the Info readers can use to jump to the reference; @TeX{}
produces output that specifies the page and section number for you.@refill

@need 700
@noindent
For example,

@example
@@xref@{Tropical Storms@}.
@end example

@noindent
produces

@example
*Note Tropical Storms::.
@end example

@noindent
and

@quotation
See Section 3.1 [Tropical Storms], page 24.
@end quotation

@noindent
(Note that in the preceding example the closing brace is followed by a
period.)@refill

You can write a clause after the cross reference, like this:@refill

@example
@@xref@{Tropical Storms@}, for more info.
@end example

@noindent
which produces

@example
*Note Tropical Storms::, for more info.
@end example

@noindent
and

@quotation
See Section 3.1 [Tropical Storms], page 24, for more info.
@end quotation

@noindent
(Note that in the preceding example the closing brace is followed by a
comma, and then by the clause, which is followed by a period.)


@node Two Arguments
@subsection @code{@@xref} with Two Arguments

With two arguments, the second is used as the name of the Info cross
reference, while the first is still the name of the node to which the
cross reference points.

@need 750
@noindent
The template is like this:

@example
@@xref@{@var{node-name}, @var{cross-reference-name}@}.
@end example

@need 700
@noindent
For example,

@example
@@xref@{Electrical Effects, Lightning@}.
@end example

@noindent
produces:

@example
*Note Lightning: Electrical Effects.
@end example

@noindent
and

@quotation
See Section 5.2 [Electrical Effects], page 57.
@end quotation

@noindent
(Note that in the preceding example the closing brace is followed by a
period; and that the node name is printed, not the cross reference name.)

You can write a clause after the cross reference, like this:

@example
@@xref@{Electrical Effects, Lightning@}, for more info.
@end example

@noindent
which produces

@example
*Note Lightning: Electrical Effects, for more info.
@end example

@noindent
and

@quotation
See Section 5.2 [Electrical Effects], page 57, for more info.
@end quotation

@noindent
(Note that in the preceding example the closing brace is followed by a
comma, and then by the clause, which is followed by a period.)


@node Three Arguments
@subsection @code{@@xref} with Three Arguments

A third argument replaces the node name in the @TeX{} output.  The third
argument should be the name of the section in the printed output, or
else state the topic discussed by that section.  Often, you will want to
use initial upper case letters so it will be easier to read when the
reference is printed.  Use a third argument when the node name is
unsuitable because of syntax or meaning.

Remember to avoid placing a comma within the title or topic section of
a cross reference, or within any other section.  The formatters divide
cross references into arguments according to the commas; a comma
within a title or other section will divide it into two arguments.  In
a reference, you need to write a title such as ``Clouds, Mist, and
Fog'' without the commas.@refill

Also, remember to write a comma or period after the closing brace of an
@code{@@xref} to terminate the cross reference.  In the following
examples, a clause follows a terminating comma.@refill


@need 750
@noindent
The template is like this:

@example
@group
@@xref@{@var{node-name}, @var{cross-reference-name}, @var{title-or-topic}@}.

@need 700
@noindent
For example,

@noindent
produces

@example
*Note Lightning: Electrical Effects, for details.
@end example

@noindent
and

@quotation
See Section 5.2 [Thunder and Lightning], page 57, for details.
@end quotation

If a third argument is given and the second one is empty, then the
third argument serves both.  (Note how two commas, side by side, mark
the empty second argument.)@refill

@example
@group
@@xref@{Electrical Effects, , Thunder and Lightning@},
for details.
@end group
@end example

@noindent
produces

@example

@end example

@noindent
and

@quotation
See Section 5.2 [Thunder and Lightning], page 57, for details.
@end quotation

As a practical matter, it is often best to write cross references with
just the first argument if the node name and the section title are the
same, and with the first and third arguments if the node name and title
are different.@refill

Here are several examples from @cite{The GNU Awk User's Guide}:@refill

@node Four and Five Arguments
@subsection @code{@@xref} with Four and Five Arguments

In a cross reference, a fourth argument specifies the name of another
Info file, different from the file in which the reference appears, and
a fifth argument specifies its title as a printed manual.@refill

Remember that a comma or period must follow the closing brace of an
@code{@@xref} command to terminate the cross reference.  In the
following examples, a clause follows a terminating comma.@refill

@need 800

@end quotation

@noindent
The title of the printed manual is typeset in italics; and the
reference lacks a page number since @TeX{} cannot know to which page a
reference refers when that reference is to another manual.@refill

Often, you will leave out the second argument when you use the long
version of @code{@@xref}.  In this case, the third argument, the topic
description, will be used as the cross reference name in Info.@refill

@noindent
The template looks like this:

@example

@var{printed-manual-title}@}, for details.

On rare occasions, you may want to refer to another Info file that
is within a single printed manual---when multiple Texinfo files are
incorporated into the same @TeX{} run but make separate Info files.
In this case, you need to specify only the fourth argument, and not
the fifth.@refill

@node Top Node Naming
@section Naming a `Top' Node
@cindex Naming a `Top' Node in references
@cindex @samp{@r{Top}} node naming for references

In a cross reference, you must always name a node.  This means that in
order to refer to a whole manual, you must identify the `Top' node by
writing it as the first argument to the @code{@@xref} command.  (This
is different from the way you write a menu entry; see @ref{Other Info
Files, , Referring to Other Info Files}.)  At the same time, to
provide a meaningful section topic or title in the printed cross
reference (instead of the word `Top'), you must write an appropriate
entry for the third argument to the @code{@@xref} command.
@refill

@noindent
Thus, to make a cross reference to @cite{The GNU Make Manual},
write:@refill

@example
@@xref@{Top, , Overview, make, The GNU Make Manual@}.

@noindent
which produces

@example
*Note Overview: (make)Top.
@end example

@noindent
and

@quotation
See section ``Overview'' in @i{The GNU Make Manual}.
@end quotation

@noindent
In this example, @samp{Top} is the name of the first node, and
@samp{Overview} is the name of the first section of the manual.


@node ref
@section @code{@@ref}
@cindex Cross references using @code{@@ref}
@cindex References using @code{@@ref}
@findex ref

@code{@@ref} is nearly the same as @code{@@xref} except that it does
not generate a `See' in the printed output, just the reference itself.
This makes it useful as the last part of a sentence.

@noindent For example,

@cindex Hurricanes
@example
For more information, @@pxref@{This@}, and @@ref@{That@}.
@end example

@noindent produces in Info:

@example
For more information, *note This::, and *note That::.
@end example

@noindent and in printed output:

@quotation
For more information, see Section 1.1 [This], page 1,
and Section 1.2 [That], page 2.
@end quotation

The @code{@@ref} command sometimes tempts writers to express
themselves in a manner that is suitable for a printed manual but looks
awkward in the Info format.  Bear in mind that your audience will be
using both the printed and the Info format.  For example:

@cindex Sea surges
@example
Sea surges are described in @@ref@{Hurricanes@}.
@end example

@noindent looks ok in the printed output:

@quotation
Sea surges are described in Section 6.7 [Hurricanes], page 72.
@end quotation

@noindent but is awkward to read in Info, ``note'' being a verb:

@example
Sea surges are described in *note Hurricanes::.
@end example

You should write a period or comma immediately after an @code{@@ref}
command with two or more arguments.  If there is no such following
punctuation, @command{makeinfo} will generate a (grammatically
incorrect) period in the Info output; otherwise, the cross-reference
would fail completely, due to the current syntax of Info format.

In general, it is best to use @code{@@ref} only when you need some
word other than ``see'' to precede the reference.  When ``see'' (or
``See'') is ok, @code{@@xref} and @code{@@pxref} are preferable.


@node pxref
@section @code{@@pxref}
@cindex Cross references using @code{@@pxref}
@cindex References using @code{@@pxref}
@findex pxref

The parenthetical reference command, @code{@@pxref}, is nearly the
same as @code{@@xref}, but it is best used at the end of a sentence or
before a closing parenthesis.  The command differs from @code{@@xref}
in two ways:

@enumerate
@item
@TeX{} typesets the reference for the printed manual with a lower case
`see' rather than an upper case `See'.

@item
The Info formatting commands automatically end the reference with a
closing colon or period, if necessary.
@end enumerate

@code{@@pxref} is designed so that the output looks right and works
right at the end of a sentence or parenthetical phrase, both in
printed output and in an Info file.  In a printed manual, a closing
comma or period should not follow a cross reference within
parentheses; such punctuation is wrong.  But in an Info file, suitable
closing punctuation must follow the cross reference so Info can
recognize its end.  @code{@@pxref} spares you the need to use
complicated methods to put a terminator into one form of the output
and not the other.

@noindent
With one argument, a parenthetical cross reference looks like this:

@cindex Flooding
@example
@dots{} storms cause flooding (@@pxref@{Hurricanes@}) @dots{}
@end example

@need 800
@noindent
which produces

@example
@group
@dots{} storms cause flooding (*note Hurricanes::) @dots{}
@end group
@end example

@noindent
and

@quotation
@dots{} storms cause flooding (see Section 6.7 [Hurricanes], page 72) @dots{}
@end quotation

With two arguments, a parenthetical cross reference has this template:

@example
@dots{} (@@pxref@{@var{node-name}, @var{cross-reference-name}@}) @dots{}
@end example

@noindent
which produces

@example
@dots{} (*note @var{cross-reference-name}: @var{node-name}.) @dots{}
@end example

@noindent
and

@quotation
@dots{} (see Section @var{nnn} [@var{node-name}], page @var{ppp}) @dots{}
@end quotation

@code{@@pxref} can be used with up to five arguments, just like
@code{@@xref} (@pxref{xref, , @code{@@xref}}).

In past versions of Texinfo, it was not allowed to write punctuation
after a @code{@@pxref}, so it could be used @emph{only} before a right
parenthesis.  This is no longer the case, so now it can be used (for
example) at the end of a sentence, where a lowercase ``see'' works
best.  For instance:

@example
@dots{} For more information, @@pxref@{More@}.
@end example

@noindent
which outputs (in Info):

@example
@dots{} For more information, *note More::.
@end example

@noindent
This works fine.  @code{@@pxref} should only be followed by a comma,
period, or right parenthesis; in other cases, @command{makeinfo} has
to insert a period to make the cross-reference work correctly in Info,
and that period looks wrong.

As a matter of general style, @code{@@pxref} is best used at the ends
of sentences.  Although it technically works in the middle of a
sentence, that location breaks up the flow of reading.


@node inforef
@section @code{@@inforef}
@cindex Cross references using @code{@@inforef}
@cindex References using @code{@@inforef}
@findex inforef

@code{@@inforef} is used for making cross references to Info
documents---even from a printed manual.  This might be because you
want to refer to conditional @code{@@ifinfo} text
(@pxref{Conditionals}), or because printed output is not available
(perhaps because there is no Texinfo source), among other
possibilities.

The command takes either two or three arguments, in the following
order:@refill

@enumerate
@item
The node name.

@item
The cross reference name (optional).

@item
The Info file name.
@end enumerate

@noindent
Separate the arguments with commas, as with @code{@@xref}.  Also, you
must terminate the reference with a comma or period after the
@samp{@}}, as you do with @code{@@xref}.@refill

@noindent
The template is:

@example
@@inforef@{@var{node-name}, @var{cross-reference-name}, @var{info-file-name}@},
@end example

@need 800
@noindent
For example,

@example
@group
@@inforef@{Advanced, Advanced Info commands, info@},
for more information.
@end group
@end example

@need 800
@noindent
produces (in Info):

@example
@group
*Note Advanced Info commands: (info)Advanced,
for more information.
@end group
@end example

@need 800
@noindent
and (in the printed output):

@quotation
See Info file @file{info}, node @samp{Advanced}, for more information.
@end quotation

(This particular example is not realistic, since the Info manual is
written in Texinfo, so all formats are available.)

The converse of @code{@@inforef} is @code{@@cite}, which is used to
refer to printed works for which no Info form exists.  @xref{cite, ,
@code{@@cite}}.


@node uref
@section @code{@@url}, @code{@@uref@{@var{url}[, @var{text}][, @var{replacement}]@}}
@findex uref
@cindex Uniform resource locator, referring to
@cindex URL, referring to

@cindex @code{href}, producing HTML
@code{@@uref} produces a reference to a uniform resource locator (url).
It takes one mandatory argument, the url, and two optional arguments
which control the text that is displayed.  In HTML output, @code{@@uref}
produces a link you can follow.

@code{@@url} is a synonym for @code{@@uref}.  Originally, @code{@@url}
had the meaning of @code{@@indicateurl}
(@pxref{indicateurl,,@code{@@indicateurl}}), but in actual practice it
was misused the vast majority of the time.  So we've changed the
meaning.

The second argument, if specified, is the text to display (the default
is the url itself); in Info and DVI output, but not in HTML output, the
url is also output.

@cindex Man page, reference to
The third argument, if specified, is the text to display, but in this
case the url is @emph{not} output in any format.  This is useful when
the text is already sufficiently referential, as in a man page.  If
the third argument is given, the second argument is ignored.

If the url is long enough to cause problems with line breaking, you
may find it useful to insert @code{@@/} at places where a line break
would be acceptable (after @samp{/} characters, for instance).  This
tells @TeX{} to allow (but not force) a line break at those places.
@xref{Line Breaks}.

Here is an example of the simple one argument form, where the url is
both the target and the text of the link:

@example
The official GNU ftp site is @@uref@{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu@}.
@end example

@noindent produces:
@display
The official GNU ftp site is @uref{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu}.
@end display


An example of the two-argument form:
@example
The official @@uref@{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu, GNU ftp site@}
holds programs and texts.
@end example

@noindent produces:
@display
The official @uref{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu, GNU ftp site}
holds programs and texts.
@end display

@noindent that is, the Info output is this:
@example
The official GNU ftp site (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu)
holds programs and texts.
@end example

@noindent and the HTML output is this:
@example
The official <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu">GNU ftp site</a>
holds programs and texts.
@end example


An example of the three-argument form:
@example
The @@uref@{/man.cgi/1/ls,,ls@} program @dots{}
@end example

@noindent produces:
@display
The @uref{/man.cgi/1/ls,,ls} program @dots{}
@end display

@noindent but with HTML:
@example
The <a href="/man.cgi/1/ls">ls</a> program @dots{}
@end example

To merely indicate a url without creating a link people can follow, use
@code{@@indicateurl} (@pxref{indicateurl, @code{@@indicateurl}}).

Some people prefer to display url's in the unambiguous format:

@display
<URL:http://@var{host}/@var{path}>
@end display

@noindent
@cindex <URL: convention, not used
You can use this form in the input file if you wish.  We feel it's not
necessary to include the @samp{<URL:} and @samp{>} in the output,
since any software that tries to detect url's in text already has to
detect them without the @samp{<URL:} to be useful.


@node cite
@section @code{@@cite}@{@var{reference}@}
@findex cite

Use the @code{@@cite} command for the name of a book that lacks a
companion Info file.  The command produces italics in the printed
manual, and quotation marks in the Info file.

If a book is written in Texinfo, it is better to use a cross reference
command since a reader can easily follow such a reference in Info.
@xref{xref, , @code{@@xref}}.


@node Marking Text

@cindex Marking words and phrases
@cindex Words and phrases, marking them
@cindex Marking text within a paragraph
@cindex Text, marking up

In Texinfo, you can mark words and phrases in a variety of ways.
The Texinfo formatters use this information to determine how to
highlight the text.
You can specify, for example, whether a word or phrase is a
defining occurrence, a metasyntactic variable, or a symbol used in a
program.  Also, you can emphasize text, in several different ways.

@node Indicating
@section Indicating Definitions, Commands, etc.
@cindex Highlighting text
@cindex Indicating commands, definitions, etc.

Texinfo has commands for indicating just what kind of object a piece of
text refers to.  For example, metasyntactic variables are marked by
@code{@@var}, and code by @code{@@code}.  Since the pieces of text are
labelled by commands that tell what kind of object they are, it is easy
to change the way the Texinfo formatters prepare such text.  (Texinfo is
an @emph{intentional} formatting language rather than a @emph{typesetting}
formatting language.)@refill

For example, in a printed manual,
code is usually illustrated in a typewriter font;
@code{@@code} tells @TeX{} to typeset this text in this font.  But it
would be easy to change the way @TeX{} highlights code to use another
font, and this change would not affect how keystroke examples are
highlighted.  If straight typesetting commands were used in the body
of the file and you wanted to make a change, you would need to check
every single occurrence to make sure that you were changing code and
not something else that should not be changed.@refill

@node Useful Highlighting
@subsection Highlighting Commands are Useful

The highlighting commands can be used to extract useful information
from the file, such as lists of functions or file names.  It is
possible, for example, to write a program in Emacs Lisp (or a keyboard
macro) to insert an index entry after every paragraph that contains
words or phrases marked by a specified command.  You could do this to
construct an index of functions if you had not already made the
entries.@refill

The commands serve a variety of purposes:@refill

@table @code
@item @@code@{@var{sample-code}@}
Indicate text that is a literal example of a piece of a program.
@xref{code,,@code{@@code}}.

@item @@kbd@{@var{keyboard-characters}@}

@xref{key,,@code{@@key}}.

@item @@samp@{@var{text}@}
Indicate text that is a literal example of a sequence of characters.
@xref{samp,,@code{@@samp}}.

@item @@verb@{@var{text}@}

@node code
@subsection @code{@@code}@{@var{sample-code}@}
@findex code

@cindex Syntactic tokens, indicating
Use the @code{@@code} command to indicate text that is a piece of a
program and which consists of entire syntactic tokens.  Enclose the
text in braces.

@cindex Expressions in a program, indicating
@cindex Keywords, indicating
@cindex Reserved words, indicating
Thus, you should use @code{@@code} for an expression in a program, for
the name of a variable or function used in a program, or for a
keyword in a programming language.

Use @code{@@code} for command names in languages that resemble
programming languages, such as Texinfo.  For example, @code{@@code} and
@code{@@samp} are produced by writing @samp{@@code@{@@@@code@}} and
@samp{@@code@{@@@@samp@}} in the Texinfo source, respectively.

@cindex Case, not altering in @code{@@code}
It is incorrect to alter the case of a word inside an @code{@@code}
command when it appears at the beginning of a sentence.  Most computer
languages are case sensitive.  In C, for example, @code{Printf} is
different from the identifier @code{printf}, and most likely is a
misspelling of it.  Even in languages which are not case sensitive, it
is confusing to a human reader to see identifiers spelled in different
ways.  Pick one spelling and always use that.  If you do not want to
start a sentence with a command name written all in lower case, you
should rearrange the sentence.

In the printed manual, @code{@@code} causes @TeX{} to typeset the
argument in a typewriter face.  In the Info file, it causes the Info
formatting commands to use single quotation marks around the text.
For example,

@example
The function returns @@code@{nil@}.
@end example

@noindent
produces this:

@quotation
The function returns @code{nil}.
@end quotation

@iftex
@noindent
and this in the Info file:
@example
The function returns `nil'.
@end example
@end iftex

Here are some cases for which it is preferable @emph{not} to use @code{@@code}:

@itemize @bullet
@item
For shell command names such as @command{ls} (use @code{@@command}).

@item
For shell options such as @samp{-c} when such options stand alone (use
@code{@@option}).

@item
Also, an entire shell command often looks better if written using
@code{@@samp} rather than @code{@@code}.  In this case, the rule is to
choose the more pleasing format.

@item
For environment variable such as @env{TEXINPUTS} (use @code{@@env}).

@item
For a string of characters shorter than a syntactic token.  For example,
if you are writing about @samp{goto-ch}, which is just a part of the
name for the @code{goto-char} Emacs Lisp function, you should use
@code{@@samp}.

@item
In general, when writing about the characters used in a token; for
example, do not use @code{@@code} when you are explaining what letters
or printable symbols can be used in the names of functions.  (Use
@code{@@samp}.)  Also, you should not use @code{@@code} to mark text
that is considered input to programs unless the input is written in a
language that is like a programming language.  For example, you should
not use @code{@@code} for the keystroke commands of GNU Emacs (use
@code{@@kbd} instead) although you may use @code{@@code} for the names
of the Emacs Lisp functions that the keystroke commands invoke.

@end itemize

Since @code{@@command}, @code{@@option}, and @code{@@env} were
introduced relatively recently, it is acceptable to use @code{@@code} or
@code{@@samp} for command names, options, and environment variables.
The new commands allow you to express the markup more precisely, but
there is no real harm in using the older commands, and of course the
long-standing manuals do so.

Ordinarily, @TeX{} will consider breaking lines at @samp{-} and
@samp{_} characters within @code{@@code} and related commands.  This
can be controlled with @code{@@allowcodebreaks}
(@pxref{allowcodebreaks,,@code{@@allowcodebreaks}}).


@node kbd
@subsection @code{@@kbd}@{@var{keyboard-characters}@}
@findex kbd
@cindex Keyboard input

Use the @code{@@kbd} command for characters of input to be typed by
users.  For example, to refer to the characters @kbd{M-a}, write:

@example
@@kbd@{M-a@}
@end example

@noindent
and to refer to the characters @kbd{M-x shell}, write:

@example
@@kbd@{M-x shell@}
@end example

@cindex User input
@cindex Slanted typewriter font, for @code{@@kbd}
By default, the @code{@@kbd} command produces a different font
(slanted typewriter instead of normal typewriter) in the printed
manual, so users can distinguish the characters that they are supposed
to type from those that the computer outputs.

In Info output, @code{@@kbd} is usually the same as @code{@@code},
producing `quotes' around its argument.  However, in typewriter-like
contexts such as the @code{@@example} environment (@pxref{example})
and @code{@@code} command itself, the quotes are omitted, since Info
format cannot use distinguishing fonts.

@findex kbdinputstyle
Since the usage of @code{@@kbd} varies from manual to manual, you can
control the font switching with the @code{@@kbdinputstyle} command.
This command has no effect on Info output.  Write this command at the
beginning of a line with a single word as an argument, one of the
following:

@vindex distinct@r{, value for @code{@@kbdinputstyle}}
@vindex example@r{, value for @code{@@kbdinputstyle}}
@vindex code@r{, value for @code{@@kbdinputstyle}}
@table @samp
@item code
Always use the same font for @code{@@kbd} as @code{@@code}.
@item example
Use the distinguishing font for @code{@@kbd} only in @code{@@example}
and similar environments.
@item distinct
(the default) Always use the distinguishing font for @code{@@kbd}.
@end table

You can embed another @@-command inside the braces of an @code{@@kbd}
command.  Here, for example, is the way to describe a command that
would be described more verbosely as ``press the @samp{r} key and then
press the @key{RETURN} key'':

@example
@@kbd@{r @@key@{RET@}@}
@end example

@noindent
This produces: @kbd{r @key{RET}}.  (The present manual uses the
default for @code{@@kbdinputstyle}.)

You also use the @code{@@kbd} command if you are spelling out the letters
you type; for example:

@example
To give the @@code@{logout@} command,
type the characters @@kbd@{l o g o u t @@key@{RET@}@}.
@end example

@noindent
This produces:

@quotation
To give the @code{logout} command,
type the characters @kbd{l o g o u t @key{RET}}.
@end quotation

(Also, this example shows that you can add spaces for clarity.  If you
explicitly want to mention a space character as one of the characters of
input, write @kbd{@@key@{SPC@}} for it.)@refill


@node key
@subsection @code{@@key}@{@var{key-name}@}
@findex key

Use the @code{@@key} command for the conventional name for a key on a
keyboard, as in:@refill

@example
@@key@{RET@}
@end example

You can use the @code{@@key} command within the argument of an
@code{@@kbd} command when the sequence of characters to be typed
includes one or more keys that are described by name.@refill

For example, to produce @kbd{C-x @key{ESC}} and @kbd{M-@key{TAB}} you
would type:

@example
@@kbd@{C-x @@key@{ESC@}@}
@@kbd@{M-@@key@{TAB@}@}
@end example

Here is a list of the recommended names for keys:
@cindex Recommended names for keys
@cindex Keys, recommended names
@cindex Names recommended for keys
@cindex Abbreviations for keys

@quotation
@table @t
@item SPC
Space
@item RET

@item LFD
Linefeed (however, since most keyboards nowadays do not have a Linefeed key,
it might be better to call this character @kbd{C-j})
@item TAB
Tab
@item BS
Backspace
@item ESC
Escape
@item DELETE
Delete
@item SHIFT
Shift
@item CTRL
Control
@item META
Meta
@end table
@end quotation

@cindex META key
There are subtleties to handling words like `meta' or `ctrl' that are
names of modifier keys.  When mentioning a character in which the
modifier key is used, such as @kbd{Meta-a}, use the @code{@@kbd} command
alone; do not use the @code{@@key} command; but when you are referring
to the modifier key in isolation, use the @code{@@key} command.  For
example, write @samp{@@kbd@{Meta-a@}} to produce @kbd{Meta-a} and
@samp{@@key@{META@}} to produce @key{META}.

As a convention in GNU manuals, @code{@@key} should not be used in
index entries.


@node samp
@subsection @code{@@samp}@{@var{text}@}
@findex samp

Use the @code{@@samp} command to indicate text that is a literal example
or `sample' of a sequence of characters in a file, string, pattern, etc.
Enclose the text in braces.  The argument appears within single
quotation marks in both the Info file and the printed manual; in
addition, it is printed in a fixed-width font.@refill

@example
To match @@samp@{foo@} at the end of the line,
use the regexp @@samp@{foo$@}.
@end example

@noindent
produces

@quotation
To match @samp{foo} at the end of the line, use the regexp
@samp{foo$}.@refill
@end quotation

Any time you are referring to single characters, you should use
@code{@@samp} unless @code{@@kbd} or @code{@@key} is more appropriate.
Also, you may use @code{@@samp} for entire statements in C and for entire
shell commands---in this case, @code{@@samp} often looks better than
@code{@@code}.  Basically, @code{@@samp} is a catchall for whatever is
not covered by @code{@@code}, @code{@@kbd}, or @code{@@key}.@refill

Only include punctuation marks within braces if they are part of the
string you are specifying.  Write punctuation marks outside the braces
if those punctuation marks are part of the English text that surrounds
the string.  In the following sentence, for example, the commas and
period are outside of the braces:@refill

@example
@group
In English, the vowels are @@samp@{a@}, @@samp@{e@},
@@samp@{i@}, @@samp@{o@}, @@samp@{u@}, and sometimes
@@samp@{y@}.
@end group
@end example

@noindent
This produces:

@quotation
In English, the vowels are @samp{a}, @samp{e},
@samp{i}, @samp{o}, @samp{u},  and sometimes
@samp{y}.
@end quotation


@node verb
@subsection @code{@@verb}@{<char>@var{text}<char>@}
@findex verb
@cindex Verbatim in-line text

@cindex Delimiter character, for verbatim
Use the @code{@@verb} command to print a verbatim sequence of
characters.

Like @LaTeX{}'s @code{\verb} command, the verbatim text can be quoted using
any unique delimiter character.  Enclose the verbatim text, including the
delimiters, in braces.  Text is printed in a fixed-width font:

@example
How many @@verb@{|@@|@}-escapes does one need to print this
@@verb@{.@@a @@b @@c.@} string or @@verb@{+@@'e@?`@!`@{@}\+@} this?
@end example

@noindent
produces

@example
How many @verb{|@|}-escapes does one need to print this
@verb{.@a @b @c.} string or these @verb{+@'e?`{}!`\+} this?
@end example

This is in contrast to @code{@@samp} (see the previous section),
@code{@@code}, and similar commands; in those cases, the argument is
normal Texinfo text, where the three characters @code{@@@{@}} are
special.  With @code{@@verb}, nothing is special except the delimiter
character you choose.

It is not reliable to use @code{@@verb} inside other Texinfo
constructs.  In particular, it does not work to use @code{@@verb} in
anything related to cross-referencing, such as section titles or
figure captions.


@node var
@subsection @code{@@var}@{@var{metasyntactic-variable}@}
@findex var

Use the @code{@@var} command to indicate metasyntactic variables.  A
@dfn{metasyntactic variable} is something that stands for another piece of
text.  For example, you should use a metasyntactic variable in the
documentation of a function to describe the arguments that are passed
to that function.@refill

Do not use @code{@@var} for the names of particular variables in
programming languages.  These are specific names from a program, so
@code{@@code} is correct for them (@pxref{code}).  For example, the
Emacs Lisp variable @code{texinfo-tex-command} is not a metasyntactic
variable; it is properly formatted using @code{@@code}.

Do not use @code{@@var} for environment variables either; @code{@@env}
is correct for them (see the next section).

The effect of @code{@@var} in the Info file is to change the case of the
argument to all upper case.  In the printed manual and HTML output, the
argument is printed in slanted type.

@need 700
For example,

@example
To delete file @@var@{filename@},
type @@samp@{rm @@var@{filename@}@}.
@end example

@noindent
produces

@quotation
To delete file @var{filename}, type @samp{rm @var{filename}}.
@end quotation

@noindent
(Note that @code{@@var} may appear inside @code{@@code},
@code{@@samp}, @code{@@file}, etc.)@refill

Write a metasyntactic variable all in lower case without spaces, and
use hyphens to make it more readable.  Thus, the Texinfo source for
the illustration of how to begin a Texinfo manual looks like
this:@refill

@example
@group
\input texinfo
@@@@setfilename @@var@{info-file-name@}
@@@@settitle @@var@{name-of-manual@}
@end group
@end example

@noindent
This produces:

@example
@group
\input texinfo
@@setfilename @var{info-file-name}
@@settitle @var{name-of-manual}
@end group
@end example

In some documentation styles, metasyntactic variables are shown with
angle brackets, for example:@refill

@example
@dots{}, type rm <filename>
@end example

@noindent
However, that is not the style that Texinfo uses.  (You can, of
course, modify the sources to @file{texinfo.tex} and the Info formatting commands
to output the @code{<@dots{}>} format if you wish.)@refill


@node env
@subsection @code{@@env}@{@var{environment-variable}@}
@findex env

Use the @code{@@env} command to indicate environment variables, as used
by many operating systems, including GNU.  Do not use it for
metasyntactic variables; use @code{@@var} instead (see the previous
section).

@code{@@env} is equivalent to @code{@@code} in its effects.
For example:

@example
The @@env@{PATH@} environment variable @dots{}
@end example
@noindent produces
@quotation
The @env{PATH} environment variable @dots{}
@end quotation


@node file
@subsection @code{@@file}@{@var{file-name}@}
@findex file

Use the @code{@@file} command to indicate text that is the name of a
file, buffer, or directory, or is the name of a node in Info.  You can
also use the command for file name suffixes.  Do not use @code{@@file}
for symbols in a programming language; use @code{@@code}.

Currently, @code{@@file} is equivalent to @code{@@samp} in its effects.
For example,@refill

@example
The @@file@{.el@} files are in
the @@file@{/usr/local/emacs/lisp@} directory.
@end example

@noindent
produces

@quotation
The @file{.el} files are in
the @file{/usr/local/emacs/lisp} directory.
@end quotation


@node command
@subsection @code{@@command}@{@var{command-name}@}
@findex command
@cindex Command names, indicating
@cindex Program names, indicating

Use the @code{@@commannd} command to indicate command names, such as
@command{ls} or @command{cc}.

@code{@@command} is equivalent to @code{@@code} in its effects.
For example:

@example
The command @@command@{ls@} lists directory contents.
@end example
@noindent produces
@quotation
The command @command{ls} lists directory contents.
@end quotation

You should write the name of a program in the ordinary text font, rather
than using @code{@@command}, if you regard it as a new English word,
such as `Emacs' or `Bison'.

When writing an entire shell command invocation, as in @samp{ls -l},
you should use either @code{@@samp} or @code{@@code} at your discretion.


@node option
@subsection @code{@@option}@{@var{option-name}@}
@findex option

Use the @code{@@option} command to indicate a command-line option; for
example, @option{-l} or @option{--version} or
@option{--output=@var{filename}}.

@code{@@option} is equivalent to @code{@@samp} in its effects.
For example:

@example
The option @@option@{-l@} produces a long listing.
@end example
@noindent produces
@quotation
The option @option{-l} produces a long listing.
@end quotation

In tables, putting options inside @code{@@code} produces a
more pleasing effect.

@node dfn
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@subsection @code{@@dfn}@{@var{term}@}
@findex dfn

Use the @code{@@dfn} command to identify the introductory or defining
use of a technical term.  Use the command only in passages whose
purpose is to introduce a term which will be used again or which the
reader ought to know.  Mere passing mention of a term for the first
time does not deserve @code{@@dfn}.  The command generates italics in
the printed manual, and double quotation marks in the Info file.  For
example:@refill

@example
Getting rid of a file is called @@dfn@{deleting@} it.
@end example

@noindent
produces

@quotation
Getting rid of a file is called @dfn{deleting} it.
@end quotation

As a general rule, a sentence containing the defining occurrence of a
term should be a definition of the term.  The sentence does not need
to say explicitly that it is a definition, but it should contain the
information of a definition---it should make the meaning clear.

@ignore
@c node ctrl, , cite, Indicating
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@c subsection @code{@@ctrl}@{@var{ctrl-char}@}
@findex ctrl

The @code{@@ctrl} command is seldom used.  It describes an ASCII
control character by inserting the actual character into the Info
file.

Usually, in Texinfo, you talk what you type as keyboard entry by
describing it with @code{@@kbd}: thus, @samp{@@kbd@{C-a@}} for
@kbd{C-a}.  Use @code{@@kbd} in this way when talking about a control
character that is typed on the keyboard by the user.  When talking
about a control character appearing in a file or a string, do not use
@code{@@kbd} since the control character is not typed.  Also, do not
use @samp{C-} but spell out @code{control-}, as in @samp{control-a},
to make it easier for a reader to understand.@refill

@code{@@ctrl} is an idea from the beginnings of Texinfo which may not
really fit in to the scheme of things.  But there may be times when
you want to use the command.  The pattern is
@code{@@ctrl@{@var{ch}@}}, where @var{ch} is an ASCII character
whose control-equivalent is wanted.  For example, to specify
@samp{control-f}, you would enter@refill

@example
@@ctrl@{f@}
@end example

@noindent
produces

@quotation
@ctrl{f}
@end quotation

In the Info file, this generates the specified control character, output
literally into the file.  This is done so a user can copy the specified
control character (along with whatever else he or she wants) into another
Emacs buffer and use it.  Since the `control-h',`control-i', and
`control-j' characters are formatting characters, they should not be
indicated with @code{@@ctrl}.@refill

In a printed manual, @code{@@ctrl} generates text to describe or
identify that control character: an uparrow followed by the character
@var{ch}.@refill
@end ignore


@node abbr
@subsection @code{@@abbr}@{@var{abbreviation}[, @var{meaning}]@}
@findex abbr

@cindex Abbreviations, tagging
You can use the @code{@@abbr} command for general abbreviations.  The
abbreviation is given as the single argument in braces, as in
@samp{@@abbr@{Comput.@}}.  As a matter of style, or for particular
abbreviations, you may prefer to omit periods, as in
@samp{@@abbr@{Mr@} Stallman}.

@code{@@abbr} accepts an optional second argument, intended to be used
for the meaning of the abbreviation.

If the abbreviation ends with a lowercase letter and a period, and is
not at the end of a sentence, and has no second argument, remember to
use the @code{@@.} command (@pxref{Not Ending a
Sentence}) to get the correct spacing.  However, you do not have to
use @code{@@.} within the abbreviation itself; Texinfo automatically
assumes periods within the abbreviation do not end a sentence.

@cindex <abbr> and <abbrev> tags
In @TeX{} and in the Info output, the first argument is printed as-is;
if the second argument is present, it is printed in parentheses after
the abbreviation.  In HTML and XML, the @code{<abbr>} tag is
used; in Docbook, the @code{<abbrev>} tag is used.  For instance:

@example
@@abbr@{Comput. J., Computer Journal@}
@end example

@noindent produces:

@display
@abbr{Comput. J., Computer Journal}
@end display

For abbreviations consisting of all capital letters, you may prefer to
use the @code{@@acronym} command instead.  See the next section for
more on the usage of these two commands.


@node acronym
@subsection @code{@@acronym}@{@var{acronym}[, @var{meaning}]@}
@findex acronym

@cindex NASA, as acronym
@cindex Acronyms, tagging
Use the @code{@@acronym} command for abbreviations written in all
capital letters, such as `@acronym{NASA}'.  The abbreviation is given as
the single argument in braces, as in @samp{@@acronym@{NASA@}}.  As
a matter of style, or for particular acronyms, you may prefer to
use periods, as in @samp{@@acronym@{N.A.S.A.@}}.

@code{@@acronym} accepts an optional second argument, intended to be
used for the meaning of the acronym.

If the acronym is at the end of a sentence, and if there is no second
argument, remember to use the @code{@@.} or similar command
(@pxref{Ending a Sentence}) to get the correct spacing.

@cindex <acronym> tag
In @TeX{}, the acronym is printed in slightly smaller font.  In the
Info output, the argument is printed as-is.  In either format, if the
second argument is present, it is printed in parentheses after the
acronym.  In HTML, Docbook, and XML, the @code{<acronym>} tag is
used.

For instance (since GNU is a recursive acronym, we use
@code{@@acronym} recursively):

@example
@@acronym@{GNU, @@acronym@{GNU@}'s Not Unix@}
@end example

@noindent produces:

@display
@acronym{GNU, @acronym{GNU}'s Not Unix}
@end display

@cindex Family names, in all capitals
In some circumstances, it is conventional to print family names in all
capitals.  Don't use @code{@@acronym} for this, since a name is not an
acronym.  Use @code{@@sc} instead (@pxref{Smallcaps}).

@code{@@abbr} and @code{@@acronym} are closely related commands: they
both signal to the reader that a shortened form is being used, and
possibly give a meaning.  When choosing whether to use these two
commands, please bear the following in mind.

@itemize @minus
@item
In standard English usage, acronyms are a subset of abbreviations:
they include pronounceable words like `@acronym{NATO}', `radar', and
`snafu', and some sources also include syllable acronyms like
`Usenet', hybrids like `@acronym{SIGGRAPH}', and unpronounceable
initialisms like `@acronym{FBI}'.

@item
In Texinfo, an acronym (but not an abbreviation) should consist only
of capital letters and periods, no lowercase.

@item
In @TeX{}, an acronym (but not an abbreviation) is printed in a
slightly smaller font.

@item
Some browsers place a dotted bottom border under abbreviations but not
acronyms.

@item
It's not essential to use either of these commands for all
abbreviations; use your judgment.  Text is perfectly readable without
them.

@end itemize


@node indicateurl
@subsection @code{@@indicateurl}@{@var{uniform-resource-locator}@}
@findex indicateurl
@cindex Uniform resource locator, indicating
@cindex URL, indicating

Use the @code{@@indicateurl} command to indicate a uniform resource
locator on the World Wide Web.  This is analogous to @code{@@file},
@code{@@var}, etc., and is purely for markup purposes.  It does not
produce a link you can follow in HTML output (use the @code{@@uref}
command for that, @pxref{uref,, @code{@@uref}}).  It is useful for
url's which do not actually exist.  For example:

@example
For example, the url might be @@indicateurl@{http://example.org/path@}.
@end example

@noindent which produces:

@display
For example, the url might be @indicateurl{http://example.org/path}.
@end display


@node email
@subsection @code{@@email}@{@var{email-address}[, @var{displayed-text}]@}
@findex email

Use the @code{@@email} command to indicate an electronic mail address.
It takes one mandatory argument, the address, and one optional argument, the
text to display (the default is the address itself).

@cindex Mailto link
In Info, the address is shown in angle brackets, preceded by the text
to display if any.  In @TeX{}, the angle brackets are omitted.  In
HTML output, @code{@@email} produces a @samp{mailto} link that usually
brings up a mail composition window.  For example:

@example
Send bug reports to @@email@{bug-texinfo@@@@gnu.org@},
suggestions to the @@email@{bug-texinfo@@@@gnu.org, same place@}.
@end example
@noindent produces
@display
Send bug reports to @email{bug-texinfo@@gnu.org},
suggestions to the @email{bug-texinfo@@gnu.org, same place}.
@end display


@node Emphasis
@section Emphasizing Text
@cindex Emphasizing text

Usually, Texinfo changes the font to mark words in the text according to
what category the words belong to; an example is the @code{@@code} command.
Most often, this is the best way to mark words.
However, sometimes you will want to emphasize text without indicating a
category.  Texinfo has two commands to do this.  Also, Texinfo has
several commands that specify the font in which @TeX{} will typeset
text.  These commands have no effect on Info and only one of them,
the @code{@@r} command, has any regular use.@refill

@menu
* emph & strong::               How to emphasize text in Texinfo.
* Smallcaps::                   How to use the small caps font.
* Fonts::                       Various font commands for printed output.
@end menu

@node emph & strong
@subsection @code{@@emph}@{@var{text}@} and @code{@@strong}@{@var{text}@}
@cindex Emphasizing text, font for
@findex emph
@findex strong

The @code{@@emph} and @code{@@strong} commands are for emphasis;
@code{@@strong} is stronger.  In printed output, @code{@@emph} produces
@emph{italics} and @code{@@strong} produces @strong{bold}.

For example,

@example
@group
@@strong@{Caution:@} @@samp@{rm * .[^.]*@}
removes @@emph@{all@} files in the directory.
@end group
@end example

@noindent
produces the following in printed output and HTML:

@quotation
@strong{Caution}: @samp{rm * .[^.]*}
removes @emph{all} files in the directory.
@end quotation

@noindent
and the following in Info:

@example
*Caution:* `rm * .[^.]*' removes _all_
files in the directory.
@end example

The @code{@@strong} command is seldom used except to mark what is, in
effect, a typographical element, such as the word `Caution' in the
preceding example.

In the Info output, @code{@@emph} surrounds the text with underscores
(@samp{_}), and @code{@@strong} puts asterisks around the text.

@quotation Caution
Do not use @code{@@strong} with the word @samp{Note}; Info will
mistake the combination for a cross reference.  (It's usually
redundant, anyway.)  Use a phrase such as @strong{Please notice} or
@strong{Caution} instead, or the optional argument to
@code{@@quotation}---@samp{Note} is allowable there.
@end quotation


@node Smallcaps
@subsection @code{@@sc}@{@var{text}@}: The Small Caps Font
@cindex Small caps font
@findex sc @r{(small caps font)}

Use the @samp{@@sc} command to set text in @sc{a small caps font}
(where possible).  Write the text you want to be in small caps between
braces in lower case, like this:

@example
Richard @@sc@{Stallman@} founded @@acronym@{GNU@}.
@end example

@noindent
This produces:

@display
Richard @sc{Stallman} founded @acronym{GNU}.
@end display

As shown here, we recommend using @code{@@acronym} for actual
acronyms (@pxref{acronym}), and reserving @code{@@sc} for special
cases where you want small caps.  The output is not the same
(@code{@@acronym} prints in a smaller text font, not the small caps
font), but more importantly it describes the actual text more
accurately.

Family names are one case where small capitals are sometimes desirable,
also as shown here.

@cindex <small> tag
@TeX{} typesets any uppercase letters between the braces of an
@code{@@sc} command in full-size capitals; only lowercase letters are
printed in the small caps font.  In the Info output, the argument to
@code{@@sc} is printed in all upper case.  In HTML, the argument is
uppercased and the output marked with the @code{<small>} tag to reduce
the font size.

Since it's redundant to mark all-uppercase text with @code{@@sc},
@command{makeinfo} warns about such usage.

We recommend using regular mixed case wherever possible.


@node Fonts
@subsection Fonts for Printing, Not Info
@cindex Fonts for printing, not Info

@findex fonttextsize
@cindex Font size, reducing
@cindex Reducing font size
@cindex Smaller fonts
Texinfo provides one command to change the size of the main body font
in the @TeX{} output for a document: @code{@@fonttextsize}.  It has no
effect at all in other output.  It takes a single argument on the
remainder of the line, which must be either @samp{10} or @samp{11}.
For example:

@example
@@fonttextsize 10
@end example

@cindex Printing cost, reducing
The effect is to reduce the body font to a 10@dmn{pt} size (the
default is 11@dmn{pt}).  Fonts for other elements, such as sections
and chapters, are reduced accordingly.  This should only be used in
conjunction with @code{@@smallbook} (@pxref{smallbook,,Printing
``Small'' Books}) or similar, since 10@dmn{pt} fonts on standard paper
(8.5x11 or A4) are too small.  One reason to use this command is to
save pages, and hence printing cost, for physical books.

Texinfo does not at present have commands to switch the font family
to use, or more general size-changing commands.

@cindex Styles, font
Texinfo also provides a number of font commands that specify font changes
in the printed manual and (where possible) in the HTML output, but
have no effect in the Info file.  All the commands apply to an
argument that follows, surrounded by braces.

@table @code
@item @@b
@findex b @r{(bold font)}
@cindex Bold font
selects @b{bold} face;

@item @@i
@findex i @r{(italic font)}
@cindex Italic font
selects an @i{italic} font;

@item @@r
@findex r @r{(roman font)}
@cindex Roman font
@cindex Default font
selects a @r{roman} font, which is the usual font in which text is
printed.  It may or may not be seriffed.

@item @@sansserif
@findex sansserif @r{(sans serif font)}
@cindex Sans serif font
selects a @sansserif{sans serif} font;

@item @@slanted
@findex slanted @r{(slanted font)}
@cindex Slanted font
@cindex Oblique font
selects a @slanted{slanted} font;

@item @@t
@findex t @r{(typewriter font)}
@cindex Monospace font
@cindex Fixed-width font
@cindex Typewriter font
selects the @t{fixed-width}, typewriter-style font used by @code{@@code};

@end table

(The commands with longer names were invented much later than the
others, at which time it did not seem desirable to use very short
names for such an infrequently needed feature.)

@cindex <lineannotation> Docbook tag
Only the @code{@@r} command has much use: in example-like
environments, you can use the @code{@@r} command to write comments in
the standard roman font instead of the fixed-width font.  This looks
better in printed output, and produces a @code{<lineannotation>} tag
in Docbook output.

For example,

@example
@group
@@lisp
(+ 2 2)    ; @@r@{Add two plus two.@}
@@end lisp
@end group
@end example

@noindent
produces

@lisp
(+ 2 2)    ; @r{Add two plus two.}
@end lisp

In general, you should avoid using the other font commands.  Some of
them are only useful when documenting functionality of specific font
effects, such as in @TeX{} and related packages.


@node Quotations and Examples
@chapter Quotations and Examples

Quotations and examples are blocks of text consisting of one or more
whole paragraphs that are set off from the bulk of the text and
treated differently.  They are usually indented in the output.

@findex end
In Texinfo, you always begin a quotation or example by writing an
@@-command at the beginning of a line by itself, and end it by writing
an @code{@@end} command that is also at the beginning of a line by
itself.  For instance, you begin an example by writing @code{@@example}
by itself at the beginning of a line and end the example by writing
@code{@@end example} on a line by itself, at the beginning of that
line, and with only one space between the @code{@@end} and the
@code{example}.

@node Block Enclosing Commands
@section Block Enclosing Commands

Here are commands for quotations and examples, explained further in the
following sections:

@table @code
@item @@quotation
Indicate text that is quoted. The text is filled, indented (from both
margins), and printed in a roman font by default.

@item @@smallquotation
Same as @code{@@quotation}, except that in @TeX{} this command typesets
text in a smaller font size.

@item @@example
Illustrate code, commands, and the like. The text is printed
in a fixed-width font, and indented but not filled.

@item @@verbatim
Mark a piece of text that is to be printed verbatim; no character
substitutions are made and all commands are ignored, until the next
@code{@@end verbatim}.  The text is printed in a fixed-width font,
and not indented or filled.  Extra spaces and blank lines are
significant, and tabs are expanded.

@item @@smallexample
Same as @code{@@example}, except that in @TeX{} this command typesets
text in a smaller font size.

@item @@lisp
Like @code{@@example}, but specifically for illustrating Lisp code. The
text is printed in a fixed-width font, and indented but not filled.

@item @@smalllisp
Is to @code{@@lisp} as @code{@@smallexample} is to @code{@@example}.

@item @@display
Display illustrative text.  The text is indented but not filled, and
no font is selected (so, by default, the font is roman).

@item @@smalldisplay
Is to @code{@@display} as @code{@@smallexample} is to @code{@@example}.

@item @@format
Like @code{@@display} (the text is not filled and no font is selected),
but the text is not indented.

@item @@smallformat
Is to @code{@@format} as @code{@@smallexample} is to @code{@@example}.
@end table

The @code{@@exdent} command is used within the above constructs to
undo the indentation of a line.

The @code{@@flushleft} and @code{@@flushright} commands are used to line
up the left or right margins of unfilled text.

The @code{@@raggedright} command fills text as usual, but only
justifies it on the left, leaving the right margin ragged.

The @code{@@noindent} command may be used after one of the above
constructs to prevent the following text from being indented as a new
paragraph.

You can use the @code{@@cartouche} environment around one of the above
constructs to highlight the example or quotation by drawing a box with
rounded corners around it.  @xref{cartouche, , Drawing Cartouches Around
Examples}.


@node quotation
@section @code{@@quotation}: Block quotations
@cindex Quotations
@findex quotation

The text of a quotation is processed normally (regular font, text is
filled) except that:

@itemize @bullet
@item
the margins are closer to the center of the page, so the whole of the
quotation is indented;

@item
and the first lines of paragraphs are indented no more than other lines.

@end itemize

@quotation
This is an example of text written between an @code{@@quotation}
command and an @code{@@end quotation} command.  An @code{@@quotation}
command is most often used to indicate text that is excerpted from
another (real or hypothetical) printed work.
@end quotation

Write an @code{@@quotation} command as text on a line by itself.  This
line will disappear from the output.  Mark the end of the quotation
with a line beginning with and containing only @code{@@end quotation}.
The @code{@@end quotation} line will likewise disappear from the
output.

@code{@@quotation} takes one optional argument, given on the remainder
of the line.  This text, if present, is included at the beginning of
the quotation in bold or otherwise emphasized, and followed with a
@samp{:}.  For example:

@example
@@quotation Note
This is
a foo.
@@end quotation
@end example

@noindent
produces

@quotation Note
This is
a foo.
@end quotation

If the @code{@@quotation} argument is exactly one of these English words:

@example
Caution  Important  Note  Tip  Warning
@end example

@cindex <note> Docbook tag
@cindex <blockquote> HTML tag
@noindent then the Docbook output uses corresponding special tags
(@code{<note>}, etc.) instead of the default @code{<blockquote>}.
HTML output always uses @code{<blockquote>}.

@findex smallquotation
Texinfo also provides a command @code{@@smallquotation}, which is just
like @code{@@quotation} but uses a smaller font size.  @xref{small}.

@findex example

The @code{@@example} environment is used to indicate an example that
is not part of the running text, such as computer input or output.
Write an @code{@@example} command at the beginning of a line by
itself.  Mark the end of the example with an @code{@@end example}
command, also written at the beginning of a line by itself.

An @code{@@example} environment has the following characteristics:

@itemize
@item Each line in the input file is a line in the output; that is,
the source text is not filled as it normally is.
@item Extra spaces and blank lines are significant.
@item The output is indented.
@item The output uses a fixed-width font.
@item Texinfo commands @emph{are} expanded; if you want the output to
be the input verbatim, use the @code{@@verbatim} environment instead
(@pxref{verbatim,,@code{@@verbatim}}).
@end itemize

For example,

@example
@@example
cp foo @@var@{dest1@}; \
 cp foo @@var@{dest2@}
@@end example
@end example

@noindent
produces

@example
cp foo @var{dest1}; \
 cp foo @var{dest2}
@end example

The lines containing @code{@@example} and @code{@@end example} will
disappear from the output.  To make the output look good, you should
put a blank line before the @code{@@example} and another blank line
after the @code{@@end example}.  Blank lines inside the beginning
@code{@@example} and the ending @code{@@end example}, on the other
hand, do appear in the output.

@quotation Caution
Do not use tabs in the lines of an example!  (Or anywhere else in
Texinfo, except in verbatim environments.)  @TeX{} treats tabs as
single spaces, and that is not what they look like.  In Emacs, you can
use @kbd{M-x untabify} to convert tabs in a region to multiple spaces.
@end quotation

Examples are often, logically speaking, ``in the middle'' of a
paragraph, and the text that continues afterwards should not be
indented, as in the example above.  The @code{@@noindent} command
prevents a piece of text from being indented as if it were a new
paragraph (@pxref{noindent,,@code{@@noindent}}.

If you want to embed code fragments within sentences, instead of
displaying them, use the @code{@@code} command or its relatives
(@pxref{code,,@code{@@code}}).

If you wish to write a ``comment'' on a line of an example in the
normal roman font, you can use the @code{@@r} command (@pxref{Fonts}).


@node verbatim
@section @code{@@verbatim}: Literal Text
@findex verbatim
@cindex Verbatim environment

Use the @code{@@verbatim} environment for printing of text that may
contain special characters or commands that should not be interpreted,
such as computer input or output (@code{@@example} interprets its text
as regular Texinfo commands).  This is especially useful for including automatically
generated files in a Texinfo manual.

In general, the output will be just the same as the input.  No
character substitutions are made, e.g., all spaces and blank lines are
significant, including tabs.  In the printed manual, the text is
typeset in a fixed-width font, and not indented or filled.

Write a @code{@@verbatim} command at the beginning of a line by itself.
This line will disappear from the output.  Mark the end of the verbatim
block with a @code{@@end verbatim} command, also written at the
beginning of a line by itself.  The @code{@@end verbatim} will also
disappear from the output.

For example:
@c oops, got to trick this a bit: can't use @end verbatim inside @verbatim

@example
@exdent @t{@@verbatim}
@exdent @t{@{}
@exdent @key{TAB}@t{@@command with strange characters: @@'e}
@exdent @t{expand@key{TAB}me}
@exdent @t{@}}
@exdent @t{@@end verbatim}
@end example

@noindent
This produces:

@verbatim
{
        @command with strange characters: @'e
expand	me
}
@end verbatim

Since the lines containing @code{@@verbatim} and @code{@@end verbatim}
produce no output, typically you should put a blank line before the
@code{@@verbatim} and another blank line after the @code{@@end
verbatim}.  Blank lines between the beginning @code{@@verbatim} and
the ending @code{@@end verbatim} will appear in the output.

@cindex Verbatim, small
@cindex Small verbatim
You can get a ``small'' verbatim by enclosing the @code{@@verbatim} in
an @code{@@smallformat} environment, as shown here:

@c more cheating ...
@smallexample
@exdent @t{@@smallformat}
@exdent @t{@@verbatim}
@exdent @t{... still verbatim, but in a smaller font ...}
@exdent @t{@@end verbatim}
@exdent @t{@@end smallformat}
@end smallexample

Finally, a word of warning: it is not reliable to use
@code{@@verbatim} inside other Texinfo constructs.


@node verbatiminclude
@section @code{@@verbatiminclude} @var{file}: Include a File Verbatim
@cindex Verbatim, include file
@cindex Including a file verbatim
@findex verbatiminclude

You can include the exact contents of a file in the document with the
@code{@@verbatiminclude} command:

@example
@@verbatiminclude @var{filename}
@end example

The contents of @var{filename} is printed in a verbatim environment
(@pxref{verbatim,,@code{@@verbatim}}).  Generally, the file is printed
exactly as it is, with all special characters and white space
retained.  No indentation is added; if you want indentation, enclose
the @code{@@verbatiminclude} within @code{@@example}
(@pxref{example,,@code{@@example}}).

The name of the file is taken literally, with a single exception:
@code{@@value@{@var{var}@}} references are expanded.  This makes it
possible to include files in other directories within a distribution,
for instance:

@example
@@verbatiminclude @@value@{top_srcdir@}/NEWS
@end example

@noindent (You still have to get @code{top_srcdir} defined in the
first place.)

For a method on printing the file contents in a smaller font size, see
the end of the previous section on @code{@@verbatim}.


@node lisp
@section @code{@@lisp}: Marking a Lisp Example
@findex lisp
@cindex Lisp example

The @code{@@lisp} command is used for Lisp code.  It is synonymous
with the @code{@@example} command.

@lisp
This is an example of text written between an
@code{@@lisp} command and an @code{@@end lisp} command.
@end lisp

Use @code{@@lisp} instead of @code{@@example} to preserve information
regarding the nature of the example.  This is useful, for example, if
you write a function that evaluates only and all the Lisp code in a
Texinfo file.  Then you can use the Texinfo file as a Lisp
library.@footnote{It would be straightforward to extend Texinfo to work
in a similar fashion for C, Fortran, or other languages.}

Mark the end of @code{@@lisp} with @code{@@end lisp} on a line by
itself.


@node small
@section @code{@@small@dots{}} Block Commands
@cindex Small examples
@cindex Examples in smaller fonts
@cindex Quotations in smaller fonts
@cindex Lisp examples in smaller fonts
@findex smallquotation
@findex smallexample
@findex smallformat
@findex smalllisp

In addition to the regular @code{@@example} and similar commands,
Texinfo has ``small'' example-style commands.  These are
@code{@@smallquotation}, @code{@@smalldisplay}, @code{@@smallexample},
@code{@@smallformat}, and @code{@@smalllisp}.

In Info output, the @code{@@small@dots{}} commands are equivalent to
their non-small companion commands.

In @TeX{}, however, the @code{@@small@dots{}} commands typeset text in
a smaller font than the non-small example commands.  Consequently,
many examples containing long lines fit on a page without needing to
be shortened.  A smaller font size is also requested in HTML output.

Mark the end of an @code{@@small@dots{}} block with a corresponding
@code{@@end small@dots{}}.  For example, pair @code{@@smallexample} with
@code{@@end smallexample}.

Here is an example of the font used by the @code{@@smallexample}
command (in Info, the output will be the same as usual):

@smallexample
@dots{} to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source
code or can get it if you want it, that you can
change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs; and that you know you can do these things.
@end smallexample

The @code{@@small@dots{}} commands use the same font style as their
normal counterparts: @code{@@smallexample} and @code{@@smalllisp} use
a fixed-width font, and everything else uses the regular font.
They also have the same behavior in other respects---whether filling
is done and whether margins are narrowed.

As a general rule, a printed document looks better if you use only one
of (for instance) @code{@@example} or @code{@@smallexample}
consistently within a chapter.


@node display
@section @code{@@display}: Examples Using the Text Font
@cindex Display formatting
@findex display

The @code{@@display} command begins a kind of example, where each line
of input produces a line of output, and the output is indented.  It is
thus like the @code{@@example} command except that, in a printed
manual, @code{@@display} does not select the fixed-width font.  In
fact, it does not specify the font at all, so that the text appears in
the same font it would have appeared in without the @code{@@display}
command.

@display
This is an example of text written between an @code{@@display} command
and an @code{@@end display} command.  The @code{@@display} command
indents the text, but does not fill it.
@end display

@findex smalldisplay
Texinfo also provides a command @code{@@smalldisplay}, which is like
@code{@@display} but uses a smaller font size.  @xref{small}.

The @code{@@table} command (@pxref{table}) does not work inside
@code{@@display}.  Since @code{@@display} is line-oriented, it doesn't
make sense to use them together.  If you want to indent a table, try
@code{@@quotation} (@pxref{quotation}).


@node format
@section @code{@@format}: Examples Using the Full Line Width
@findex format

The @code{@@format} command is similar to @code{@@example} except
that, in the printed manual, @code{@@format} does not select the
fixed-width font and does not narrow the margins.

@format
This is an example of text written between an @code{@@format} command
and an @code{@@end format} command.  As you can see
from this example,
the @code{@@format} command does not fill the text.
@end format

@findex smallformat
Texinfo also provides a command @code{@@smallformat}, which is like
@code{@@format} but uses a smaller font size.  @xref{small}.


@node exdent
@section @code{@@exdent}: Undoing a Line's Indentation
@cindex Indentation undoing
@findex exdent

The @code{@@exdent} command removes any indentation a line might have.
The command is written at the beginning of a line and applies only to
the text that follows the command that is on the same line.  Do not use
braces around the text.  In a printed manual, the text on an
@code{@@exdent} line is printed in the roman font.@refill

@code{@@exdent} is usually used within examples.  Thus,@refill

@example
@group
@@example
This line follows an @@@@example command.
@@exdent This line is exdented.
This line follows the exdented line.
The @@@@end example comes on the next line.
@@end example
@end group
@end example

@noindent
produces

@example
@group
This line follows an @@example command.
@exdent This line is exdented.
This line follows the exdented line.
The @@end example comes on the next line.
@end group
@end example

In practice, the @code{@@exdent} command is rarely used.
Usually, you un-indent text by ending the example and
returning the page to its normal width.@refill


@node flushleft & flushright
@section @code{@@flushleft} and @code{@@flushright}
@findex flushleft
@findex flushright
@cindex Ragged right
@cindex Ragged left

The @code{@@flushleft} and @code{@@flushright} commands line up the
ends of lines on the left and right margins of a page,
but do not fill the text.  The commands are written on lines of their
own, without braces.  The @code{@@flushleft} and @code{@@flushright}
commands are ended by @code{@@end flushleft} and @code{@@end
flushright} commands on lines of their own.@refill

@need 1500
For example,

@example
@group
@@flushleft
This text is
written flushleft.
@@end flushleft
@end group
@end example

@noindent
produces

@quotation
@flushleft
This text is
written flushleft.
@end flushleft
@end quotation


@code{@@flushright} produces the type of indentation often used in the
return address of letters.  For example,

@example
@group
@@flushright
Here is an example of text written
flushright.  The @@code@{@@flushright@} command
right justifies every line but leaves the
left end ragged.
@@end flushright
@end group
@end example

@noindent
produces

@flushright
Here is an example of text written
flushright.  The @code{@@flushright} command
right justifies every line but leaves the
left end ragged.
@end flushright


@node raggedright
@section @code{@@raggedright}
@findex raggedright
@cindex Ragged right

The @code{@@raggedright} fills text as usual, but the text is only
justified on the left; the right margin is ragged.  The command is
written on a line of its own, without braces.  The
@code{@@raggedright} command is ended by @code{@@end raggedright} on a
line of its own.  This command has no effect in Info or HTML output,
where text is always set ragged right.

The @code{@@raggedright} command can be useful with paragraphs
containing lists of commands with long names, when it is known in
advance that justifying the text on both margins will make the
paragraph look bad.

For example,

@example
@group
@@raggedright
Commands for double and single angle quotation marks:
@@code@{@@@@guillemetleft@@@{@@@}@}, @@code@{@@@@guillemetright@@@{@@@}@},
@@code@{@@@@guillemotleft@@@{@@@}@}, @@code@{@@@@guillemotright@@@{@@@}@},
@@code@{@@@@guilsinglleft@@@{@@@}@}, @@code@{@@@@guilsinglright@@@{@@@}@}.
@@end raggedright
@end group
@end example

@noindent
produces

@raggedright
Commands for double and single angle quotation marks:
@code{@@guillemetleft@{@}}, @code{@@guillemetright@{@}},
@code{@@guillemotleft@{@}}, @code{@@guillemotright@{@}},
@code{@@guilsinglleft@{@}}, @code{@@guilsinglright@{@}}.
@end raggedright


@node noindent
@section @code{@@noindent}: Omitting Indentation
@cindex Omitting indentation
@cindex Suppressing indentation
@cindex Indentation, omitting
@findex noindent

An example or other inclusion can break a paragraph into segments.
Ordinarily, the formatters indent text that follows an example as a new
paragraph.  You can prevent this on a case-by-case basis by writing
@code{@@noindent} at the beginning of a line, preceding the continuation
text.  You can also disable indentation for all paragraphs globally with
@code{@@paragraphindent} (@pxref{paragraphindent, Paragraph Indenting}).

It is best to write @code{@@noindent} on a line by itself, since in most
environments, spaces following the command will not be ignored.  It's ok
to use it at the beginning of a line, with text following, outside of
any environment.

@need 1500
For example:

@example
@group
@@example
This is an example
@@end example

@@noindent
This line is not indented.  As you can see, the
beginning of the line is fully flush left with the line
that follows after it.  (This whole example is between
@@code@{@@@@display@} and @@code@{@@@@end display@}.)
@end group
@end example

@noindent produces:

@display

@example
This is an example
@end example

@noindent
This line is not indented.  As you can see, the
beginning of the line is fully flush left with the line
that follows after it.  (This whole example is between
@code{@@display} and @code{@@end display}.)

@end display

To adjust the number of blank lines properly in the Info file output,
remember that the line containing @code{@@noindent} does not generate a
blank line, and neither does the @code{@@end example} line.

In the Texinfo source file for this manual, each line that says
`produces' is preceded by @code{@@noindent}.

Do not put braces after an @code{@@noindent} command; they are not
necessary, since @code{@@noindent} is a command used outside of
paragraphs (@pxref{Command Syntax}).


@node indent
@section @code{@@indent}: Forcing Indentation
@cindex Forcing indentation
@cindex Inserting indentation
@cindex Indentation, forcing
@findex indent

@indent
To complement the @code{@@noindent} command (see the previous
section), Texinfo provides the @code{@@indent} command that forces a
paragraph to be indented.  This paragraph, for instance, is indented
using an @code{@@indent} command.  The first paragraph of a section is
the most likely place to use @code{@@indent}, to override the normal
behavior of no indentation there (@pxref{paragraphindent}).

It is best to write @code{@@indent} on a line by itself, since in most
environments, spaces following the command will not be ignored.  The
@code{@@indent} line will not generate a blank line in the Info output
within an environment.

However, it is ok to use it at the beginning of a line, with text
following, outside of any environment.

Do not put braces after an @code{@@indent} command; they are not
necessary, since @code{@@indent} is a command used outside of
paragraphs (@pxref{Command Syntax}).


@node cartouche
@section @code{@@cartouche}: Rounded Rectangles Around Examples
@findex cartouche
@cindex Box with rounded corners
@cindex Rounded rectangles, around examples

In a printed manual, the @code{@@cartouche} command draws a box with
rounded corners around its contents.  In HTML, a normal rectangle is
drawn (that's the best HTML can do).  @code{@@cartouche} has no effect
in Info output.

You can use this command to further highlight an example or quotation.
For instance, you could write a manual in which one type of example is
surrounded by a cartouche for emphasis.

For example,

@example
@@cartouche
@@example
% pwd
/usr/local/share/emacs
@@end example
@@end cartouche
@end example

@noindent
surrounds the two-line example with a box with rounded corners, in the
printed manual.

The output from the example looks like this (if you're reading this in
Info, you'll see the @code{@@cartouche} had no effect):

@cartouche
@example
% pwd
/usr/local/info
@end example
@end cartouche

For proper output in HTML, it's necessary to put the
@code{@@cartouche} around the @code{@@example}, and not the other way
around.  This limitation of @command{makeinfo} may be removed one day.

@code{@@cartouche} also implies @code{@@group} (@pxref{group}).

Texinfo has several ways of making lists and tables.  Lists can be
bulleted or numbered; two-column tables can highlight the items in
the first column; multi-column tables are also supported.

@end menu

@node Introducing Lists
@section Introducing Lists

Texinfo automatically indents the text in lists or tables, and numbers
an enumerated list.  This last feature is useful if you modify the
list, since you do not need to renumber it yourself.@refill

Numbered lists and tables begin with the appropriate @@-command at the
beginning of a line, and end with the corresponding @code{@@end}
command on a line by itself.  The table and itemized-list commands
also require that you write formatting information on the same line as
the beginning @@-command.@refill

Begin an enumerated list, for example, with an @code{@@enumerate}
command and end the list with an @code{@@end enumerate} command.
Begin an itemized list with an @code{@@itemize} command, followed on
the same line by a formatting command such as @code{@@bullet}, and end
the list with an @code{@@end itemize} command.@refill
@findex end

Precede each element of a list with an @code{@@item} or @code{@@itemx}
command.@refill

@node itemize
@section @code{@@itemize}: Making an Itemized List
@cindex Itemization
@findex itemize

The @code{@@itemize} command produces sequences of indented
paragraphs, with a bullet or other mark inside the left margin
at the beginning of each paragraph for which such a mark is desired.@refill

@cindex @code{@@w}, for blank items
Begin an itemized list by writing @code{@@itemize} at the beginning of
a line.  Follow the command, on the same line, with a character or a
Texinfo command that generates a mark.  Usually, you will write
@code{@@bullet} after @code{@@itemize}, but you can use
@code{@@minus}, or any command or character that results in a single
character in the Info file.  (When you write the mark command such as
@code{@@bullet} after an @code{@@itemize} command, you may omit the
@samp{@{@}}.)  If you don't specify a mark command, the default is
@code{@@bullet}.  If you don't want any mark at all, use
@code{@@w@{@}} (in this case the braces are required).

Write the text of the indented paragraphs themselves after the
@code{@@itemize}, up to another line that says @code{@@end
itemize}.@refill

@findex item
At the beginning of each paragraph for which a mark in the margin is
desired, write a line that starts with @code{@@item}.  It is ok to
have text following the @code{@@item}.

Usually, you should put a blank line before an @code{@@item}.  This
puts a blank line in the Info file. (@TeX{} inserts the proper
interline whitespace in either case.)  Except when the entries are
very brief, these blank lines make the list look better.@refill

Here is an example of the use of @code{@@itemize}, followed by the
output it produces.  @code{@@bullet} produces an @samp{*} in Info and a
round dot in @TeX{}.

@example
@group
@@itemize @@bullet
@@item
Some text for foo.

@@item
Some text
for bar.
@@end itemize
@end group
@end example

@noindent
This produces:

@quotation
@itemize @bullet
@item

@end itemize
@end quotation

Itemized lists may be embedded within other itemized lists.  Here is a

@node enumerate
@section @code{@@enumerate}: Making a Numbered or Lettered List
@cindex Enumeration
@findex enumerate

@code{@@enumerate} is like @code{@@itemize} (@pxref{itemize,,
@code{@@itemize}}), except that the labels on the items are
successive integers or letters instead of bullets.

Write the @code{@@enumerate} command at the beginning of a line.  The
command does not require an argument, but accepts either a number or a
letter as an option.  Without an argument, @code{@@enumerate} starts the
list with the number @samp{1}.  With a numeric argument, such as
@samp{3}, the command starts the list with that number.  With an upper
or lower case letter, such as @samp{a} or @samp{A}, the command starts
the list with that letter.

Write the text of the enumerated list in the same way as an itemized
list: write a line starting with @code{@@item} at the beginning of
each paragraph that you want enumerated.  It is ok to have text
following the @code{@@item}.

You should put a blank line between entries in the list.
This generally makes it easier to read the Info file.

@need 1500

have a list of terms and a brief text with each one.

Write the @code{@@table} command at the beginning of a line, after a
blank line, and follow it on the same line with an argument that is a
Texinfo ``indicating'' command such as @code{@@code}, @code{@@samp},
@code{@@var}, @code{@@option}, or @code{@@kbd} (@pxref{Indicating}).

This command will be applied to the text that goes into the first
column of each item and thus determines how it will be highlighted.
For example, @code{@@table @@code} will cause the text in the first
column to be output as if it @code{@@code} command.

@findex asis
You may also use the @code{@@asis} command as an argument to
@code{@@table}.  @code{@@asis} is a command that does nothing; if you
use this command after @code{@@table}, the first column entries are
output without added highlighting (``as is'').

The @code{@@table} command works with other commands besides those
explicitly mentioned here.  However, you can only use commands that
normally take arguments in braces.  (In this case, however, you use
the command name without an argument, because the subsequent
@code{@@item}'s will supply the argument.)

@findex item
Begin each table entry with an @code{@@item} command at the beginning
of a line.  Write the first column text on the same line as the
@code{@@item} command.  Write the second column text on the line
following the @code{@@item} line and on subsequent lines.  (You do not
need to type anything for an empty second column entry.)  You may
write as many lines of supporting text as you wish, even several
paragraphs.  But only the text on the same line as the @code{@@item}
will be placed in the first column (including any footnotes).

Normally, you should put a blank line before an @code{@@item} line.
This puts a blank line in the Info file.  Except when the entries are
very brief, a blank line looks better.

End the table with a line consisting of @code{@@end table}, followed
by a blank line.  @TeX{} will always start a new paragraph after the
table, so the blank line is needed for the Info output to be analogous.

@need 1500
The following table, for example, highlights the text in the first
column with an @code{@@samp} command:

@example
@group
@@table @@samp
@@item foo
This is the text for
@@samp@{foo@}.

@@item bar
Text for @@samp@{bar@}.
@@end table
@end group
@end example

@noindent
This produces:

@table @samp
@item foo
This is the text for
@samp{foo}.
@item bar
Text for @samp{bar}.
@end table

If you want to list two or more named items with a single block of
text, use the @code{@@itemx} command.  (@xref{itemx,,@code{@@itemx}}.)

@cindex Tables with indexes
@cindex Indexing table entries automatically
@findex ftable
@findex vtable

The @code{@@ftable} and @code{@@vtable} commands are the same as the
@code{@@table} command except that @code{@@ftable} automatically enters
each of the items in the first column of the table into the index of
functions and @code{@@vtable} automatically enters each of the items in
the first column of the table into the index of variables.  This
simplifies the task of creating indices.  Only the items on the same
line as the @code{@@item} commands are indexed, and they are indexed in
exactly the form that they appear on that line.  @xref{Indices},
for more information about indices.@refill

Begin a two-column table using @code{@@ftable} or @code{@@vtable} by
writing the @@-command at the beginning of a line, followed on the same
line by an argument that is a Texinfo command such as @code{@@code},
exactly as you would for an @code{@@table} command; and end the table
with an @code{@@end ftable} or @code{@@end vtable} command on a line by
itself.

See the example for @code{@@table} in the previous section.

@node itemx
@subsection @code{@@itemx}
@cindex Two named items for @code{@@table}
@findex itemx

Use the @code{@@itemx} command inside a table when you have two or more
first column entries for the same item, each of which should appear on a
line of its own.

Use @code{@@item} for the first entry, and @code{@@itemx} for all
subsequent entries; @code{@@itemx} must always follow an @code{@@item}
command, with no blank line intervening.

The @code{@@itemx} command works exactly like @code{@@item} except
that it does not generate extra vertical space above the first column
text.  If you have multiple consecutive @code{@@itemx} commands, do
not insert any blank lines between them.

For example,

@example
@group
@@table @@code
@@item upcase
@@itemx downcase
These two functions accept a character or a string as
argument, and return the corresponding upper case (lower
case) character or string.
@@end table
@end group

@noindent
This produces:

@table @code
@item upcase
@itemx downcase
These two functions accept a character or a string as

@node Multi-column Tables
@section @code{@@multitable}: Multi-column Tables
@cindex Tables, making multi-column
@findex multitable

@code{@@multitable} allows you to construct tables with any number of
columns, with each column having any width you like.

You define the column widths on the @code{@@multitable} line itself, and
write each row of the actual table following an @code{@@item} command,
with columns separated by an @code{@@tab} command.  Finally, @code{@@end
multitable} completes the table.  Details in the sections below.

@menu
* Multitable Column Widths::    Defining multitable column widths.
* Multitable Rows::             Defining multitable rows, with examples.
@end menu

@node Multitable Column Widths
@subsection Multitable Column Widths
@cindex Multitable column widths
@cindex Column widths, defining for multitables
@cindex Widths, defining multitable column

You can define the column widths for a multitable in two ways: as
fractions of the line length; or with a prototype row.  Mixing the two
methods is not supported.  In either case, the widths are defined
entirely on the same line as the @code{@@multitable} command.

@enumerate
@item
@findex columnfractions
@cindex Line length, column widths as fraction of
To specify column widths as fractions of the line length, write
@code{@@columnfractions} and the decimal numbers (presumably less than
1; a leading zero is allowed and ignored) after the
@code{@@multitable} command, as in:

@example
@@multitable @@columnfractions .33 .33 .33
@end example

The fractions need not add up exactly to 1.0, as these do not.  This
allows you to produce tables that do not need the full line length.

@item
@cindex Prototype row, column widths defined by
To specify a prototype row, write the longest entry for each column
enclosed in braces after the @code{@@multitable} command.  For example:

@example
@@multitable @{some text for column one@} @{for column two@}
@end example

@noindent
The first column will then have the width of the typeset `some text for
column one', and the second column the width of `for column two'.

The prototype entries need not appear in the table itself.

Although we used simple text in this example, the prototype entries can
contain Texinfo commands; markup commands such as @code{@@code} are
particularly likely to be useful.

@end enumerate


@node Multitable Rows
@subsection Multitable Rows
@cindex Multitable rows
@cindex Rows, of a multitable

@findex item
@findex tab
After the @code{@@multitable} command defining the column widths (see
the previous section), you begin each row in the body of a multitable
with @code{@@item}, and separate the column entries with @code{@@tab}.
Line breaks are not special within the table body, and you may break
input lines in your source file as necessary.

@findex headitem
@cindex Heading row, in table
@cindex <thead> HTML tag
You can also use @code{@@headitem} instead of @code{@@item} to produce
a @dfn{heading row}.  The @TeX{} output for such a row is in bold, and
the HTML, XML, and Docbook output uses the @code{<thead>} tag.  In
Info, the heading row is followed by a separator line made of dashes
(@samp{-} characters).

@findex headitemfont
@cindex Font for multitable heading rows
The command @code{@@headitemfont} can be used in templates when the
entries in a @code{@@headitem} row need to be used in a template.  It
is a synonym for @code{@@b}, but using @code{@@headitemfont} avoids
any dependency on that particular font style, in case we provide a way
to change it in the future.

@node Special Displays
@chapter Special Displays
@cindex Special displays

The commands in this chapter allow you to write text that is specially
displayed (output format permitting), outside of the normal document
flow.

One set of such commands is for creating ``floats'', that is, figures,
tables, and the like, set off from the main text, possibly numbered,
captioned, and/or referred to from elsewhere in the document.  Images
are often included in these displays.

Another group of commands is for creating footnotes in Texinfo.

@end menu


@node Floats
@section Floats
@cindex Floats, in general

A @dfn{float} is a display which is set off from the main text.  It is
typically labelled as being a ``Figure'', ``Table'', ``Example'', or
some similar type.

@cindex Floating, not yet implemented
A float is so-named because, in principle, it can be moved to the
bottom or top of the current page, or to a following page, in the
printed output.  (Floating does not make sense in other output
formats.)  In the present version of Texinfo, however, this floating
is unfortunately not yet implemented.  Instead, the floating material
is simply output at the current location, more or less as if it were
an @code{@@group} (@pxref{group,,@code{@@group}}).

@menu
* float::                       Producing floating material.
* caption shortcaption::        Specifying descriptions for floats.
* listoffloats::                A table of contents for floats.
@end menu


@node float
@subsection @code{@@float} [@var{type}][,@var{label}]: Floating Material
@findex float
@cindex Float environment

To produce floating material, enclose the material you want to be
displayed separate between @code{@@float} and @code{@@end float}
commands, on lines by themselves.

Floating material uses @code{@@image} to display an already-existing
graphic (@pxref{Images}), or @code{@@multitable} to display a table
(@pxref{Multi-column Tables}).  However, the contents of the float can
be anything.  Here's an example with simple text:

@example
@@float Figure,fig:ex1
This is an example float.
@@end float
@end example

@noindent And the output:

@float Figure,fig:ex1
This is an example float.
@end float

As shown in the example, @code{@@float} takes two arguments (separated
by a comma), @var{type} and @var{label}.  Both are optional.

@table @var
@item type
Specifies the sort of float this is; typically a word such as
``Figure'', ``Table'', etc.  If not given, and @var{label} is, any
cross-referencing will simply use a bare number.

@item label
Specifies a cross-reference label for this float.  If given, this
float is automatically given a number, and will appear in any
@code{@@listoffloats} output (@pxref{listoffloats}).  Cross-references
to @var{label} are allowed.

@cindex Floats, making unnumbered
@cindex Unnumbered float, creating
On the other hand, if @var{label} is not given, then the float will
not be numbered and consequently will not appear in the
@code{@@listoffloats} output or be cross-referenceable.
@end table

@noindent Normally, you specify both @var{type} and @var{label}, to get a
labeled and numbered float.

@cindex Floats, numbering of
@cindex Numbering of floats
In Texinfo, all floats are numbered the same way: with the chapter
number (or appendix letter), a period, and the float number, which
simply counts 1, 2, 3, @dots{}, and is reset at each chapter.  Each
float type is counted independently.

Floats within an @code{@@unnumbered} are numbered, or outside of any
chapter, are simply numbered consecutively from 1.

These numbering conventions are not, at present, changeable.


@node caption shortcaption
@subsection @code{@@caption} & @code{@@shortcaption}
@findex caption
@findex shortcaption
@cindex Captions, for floats
@cindex Short captions, for lists of floats

You may write an @code{@@caption} anywhere within a @code{@@float}
environment, to define a caption for the float.  It is not allowed in
any other context.  @code{@@caption} takes a single argument, enclosed
in braces.  Here's an example:

@example
@@float
An example float, with caption.
@@caption@{Caption for example float.@}
@@end float
@end example

@noindent The output is:

@float
An example float, with caption.
@caption{Caption for example float.}
@end float

@code{@@caption} can appear anywhere within the float; it is not
processed until the @code{@@end float}.  The caption text is usually a
sentence or two, but may consist of several paragraphs if necessary.

In the output, the caption always appears below the float; this is not
currently changeable.  It is preceded by the float type and/or number,
as specified to the @code{@@float} command (see the previous section).

The @code{@@shortcaption} command likewise may be used only within
@code{@@float}, and takes a single argument in braces.  The short
caption text is used instead of the caption text in a list of floats
(see the next section).  Thus, you can write a long caption for the
main document, and a short title to appear in the list of floats.  For
example:

@example
@@float
... as above ...
@@shortcaption@{Text for list of floats.@}
@@end float
@end example

The text for @code{@@caption} and @code{@@shortcaption} may not
contain comments (@code{@@c}), verbatim text (@code{@@verb}),
environments such as @code{@@example}, or other complex constructs.


@node listoffloats
@subsection @code{@@listoffloats}: Tables of Contents for Floats
@findex listoffloats
@cindex List of floats
@cindex Floats, list of
@cindex Table of contents, for floats

You can write a @code{@@listoffloats} command to generate a list of
floats for a given float type (@pxref{float}), analogous to the
document's overall table of contents.  Typically, it is written in its
own @code{@@unnumbered} node to provide a heading and structure,
rather like @code{@@printindex} (@pxref{Printing Indices & Menus}).

@code{@@listoffloats} takes one optional argument, the float type.
Here's an example:

@example
@@node List of Figures
@@unnumbered List of Figures
@@listoffloats Figure
@end example

@noindent And the output from @code{@@listoffloats}:

@display
@listoffloats Figure
@end display

Without any argument, @code{@@listoffloats} generates a list of
floats for which no float type was specified, i.e., no first argument
to the @code{@@float} command (@pxref{float}).

Each line in the list of floats contains the float type (if any),
the float number, and the caption, if any---the @code{@@shortcaption}
argument, if it was specified, else the @code{@@caption} argument.
In Info, the result is a menu where each float can be selected.  In
HTML, each line is a link to the float.  In printed output, the page
number is included.

Unnumbered floats (those without cross-reference labels) are omitted
from the list of floats.


@node Images
@section Inserting Images

@cindex Images, inserting
@cindex Pictures, inserting
@findex image

You can insert an image given in an external file with the
@code{@@image} command.  Although images can be used anywhere,
including the middle of a paragraph, we describe them in this chapter
since they are most often part of a displayed figure or example.

@menu
* Image Syntax::
* Image Scaling::
@end menu


@node Image Syntax
@subsection Image Syntax

Here is the synopsis of the @code{@@image} command:

@example
@@image@{@var{filename}@r{[,} @var{width}@r{[,} @var{height}@r{[,} @var{alttext}@r{[, }@var{extension}@r{]]]]}@}
@end example

@cindex Formats for images
@cindex Image formats
The @var{filename} argument is mandatory, and must not have an
extension, because the different processors support different formats:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@pindex eps image format
@TeX{} reads the file @file{@var{filename}.eps} (Encapsulated PostScript
format).
@item
@pindex pdftex@r{, and images}
@pindex png image format
@pindex jpeg image format
@pindex pdf image inclusions
pdf@TeX{} reads @file{@var{filename}.png}, @file{@var{filename}.jpg},
@file{@var{filename}.jpeg}, or @file{@var{filename}.pdf} (in that
order).  It also tries uppercase versions of the extensions.  The PDF
format cannot support EPS images, so they must be converted first.
@item
@code{makeinfo} includes @file{@var{filename}.txt} verbatim for
Info output (more or less as if it was an @code{@@example}).
@item
@code{makeinfo} uses the optional fifth argument @var{extension} to
@code{@@image} for the filename extension, if it is specified.  For example:

@pindex XPM image format
@example
@@image@{foo,,,,.xpm@}
@end example

@noindent
will cause @code{makeinfo} to look for @file{foo.xpm} before any others.

@end itemize

If you want to install image files for use by Info readers too, we
recommend putting them in a subdirectory like @samp{@var{foo}-figures}
for a package @var{foo}.  Copying the files into
@code{$(infodir)/@var{foo}-figures/} should be done in your
@code{Makefile}.

The @var{width} and @var{height} arguments are described in the next
section.

For @TeX{} output, if an image is the only thing in a paragraph it
will ordinarily be displayed on a line by itself, respecting the
current environment indentation, but without the normal paragraph
indentation.  If you want it centered, use @code{@@center}
(@pxref{titlefont center sp,,@code{@@titlefont @@center @@sp}}).

@cindex Alt attribute for images
@cindex Images, alternate text for
@findex - (in image alt string)
For HTML output, @code{makeinfo} sets the @dfn{alt attribute} for
inline images to the optional @var{alttext} (fourth) argument to
@code{@@image}, if supplied.  If not supplied, @code{makeinfo} uses
the full file name of the image being displayed.  The @var{alttext} is
taken as Texinfo text, so special characters such as @samp{"} and
@samp{<} and @samp{&} are escaped in the HTML and XML output; also,
you can get an empty @code{alt} string with @code{@@-} (a command
that produces no output; @pxref{- and hyphenation}).

For Info output, the @code{alt} string is also processed as Texinfo
text and output.  In this case, @samp{\} is escaped as @samp{\\} and
@samp{"} as @samp{\"}; no other escapes are done.

@cindex PNG image format
@cindex JPEG image format
If you do not supply the optional @var{extension} (fifth) argument,
@code{makeinfo} first tries @file{@var{filename}.png}; if that does
not exist, it tries @file{@var{filename}.jpg}.  If that does not exist
either, it complains.

In Info output, @code{makeinfo} writes a reference to the binary image
file (trying @var{filename} suffixed with @file{@var{extension}},
@file{@var{.extension}}, @file{.png}, or @file{.jpg}, in that order)
if one exists.  It also literally includes the @file{.txt} file if one
exists.  This way, Info readers which can display images (such as the
Emacs Info browser, running under X) can do so, whereas Info readers
which can only use text (such as the standalone Info reader) can
display the textual version.

@cindex @samp{^@@^H} for images in Info
The implementation of this is to put the following construct into the
Info output:

@example
^@@^H[image src="@var{binaryfile}" text="@var{txtfile}"
           alt="@var{alttext} ... ^@@^H]
@end example

@noindent where @samp{^@@} and @samp{^H} stand for the actual null and
backspace control characters.  If one of the files is not present, the
corresponding argument is omitted.

The reason for mentioning this here is that older Info browsers (this
feature was introduced in Texinfo version 4.6) will display the above
literally, which, although not pretty, should not be harmful.


@node Image Scaling
@subsection Image Scaling

@cindex Images, scaling
@cindex Scaling images
@cindex Width of images
@cindex Height of images
@cindex Aspect ratio of images
@cindex Distorting images
The optional @var{width} and @var{height} arguments to the
@code{@@image} command (see the previous section) specify the size to
scale the image to.  They are ignored for Info output.  If neither is
specified, the image is presented in its natural size (given in the
file); if only one is specified, the other is scaled proportionately;
and if both are specified, both are respected, thus possibly distorting
the original image by changing its aspect ratio.

@cindex Dimensions and image sizes
The @var{width} and @var{height} may be specified using any valid @TeX{}
dimension, namely:

@table @asis
@item pt
@cindex Points (dimension)
point (72.27pt = 1in)
@item pc
@cindex Picas
pica (1pc = 12pt)
@item bp
@cindex Big points
big point (72bp = 1in)
@item in
@cindex Inches
inch
@item cm
@cindex Centimeters
centimeter (2.54cm = 1in)
@item mm
@cindex Millimeters
millimeter (10mm = 1cm)
@item dd
@cindex Did@^ot points
did@^ot point (1157dd = 1238pt)
@item cc
@cindex Ciceros
cicero (1cc = 12dd)
@item sp
@cindex Scaled points
scaled point (65536sp = 1pt)
@end table

@pindex ridt.eps
For example, the following will scale a file @file{ridt.eps} to one
inch vertically, with the width scaled proportionately:

@example
@@image@{ridt,,1in@}
@end example

@pindex epsf.tex
For @code{@@image} to work with @TeX{}, the file @file{epsf.tex} must be
installed somewhere that @TeX{} can find it.  (The standard location is
@file{@var{texmf}/tex/generic/dvips/epsf.tex}, where @var{texmf} is a
root of your @TeX{} directory tree.)  This file is included in the
Texinfo distribution and is also available from
@uref{ftp://tug.org/tex/epsf.tex}, among other places.

@code{@@image} can be used within a line as well as for displayed
figures.  Therefore, if you intend it to be displayed, be sure to leave
a blank line before the command, or the output will run into the
preceding text.

Image scaling is presently implemented only in @TeX{}, not in HTML or
any other sort of output.


@node Footnotes
@section Footnotes
@cindex Footnotes
@findex footnote

A @dfn{footnote} is for a reference that documents or elucidates the
primary text.@footnote{A footnote should complement or expand upon the
primary text, but a reader should not need to read a footnote to
understand the primary text.  For a thorough discussion of footnotes,
see @cite{The Chicago Manual of Style}, which is published by the
University of Chicago Press.}  Footnotes are distracting; use them
sparingly at most, and it is best to avoid them completely.  Standard
bibliographical references are better placed in a bibliography at the
end of a document instead of in footnotes throughout.

@menu
* Footnote Commands::           How to write a footnote in Texinfo.
* Footnote Styles::             Controlling how footnotes appear in Info.
@end menu


@node Footnote Commands
@subsection Footnote Commands

In Texinfo, footnotes are created with the @code{@@footnote} command.
This command is followed immediately by a left brace, then by the text
of the footnote, and then by a terminating right brace.  Footnotes may
be of any length (they will be broken across pages if necessary), but
are usually short.  The template is:

@example
ordinary text@@footnote@{@var{text of footnote}@}
@end example

As shown here, the @code{@@footnote} command should come right after the
text being footnoted, with no intervening space; otherwise, the footnote
marker might end up starting a line.

For example, this clause is followed by a sample footnote@footnote{Here
is the sample footnote.}; in the Texinfo source, it looks like
this:

@example
@dots{}a sample footnote@@footnote@{Here is the sample
footnote.@}; in the Texinfo source@dots{}
@end example

As you can see, the source includes two punctuation marks next to each
other; in this case, @samp{.@};} is the sequence.  This is normal (the
first ends the footnote and the second belongs to the sentence being
footnoted), so don't worry that it looks odd.

In a printed manual or book, the reference mark for a footnote is a
small, superscripted number; the text of the footnote appears at the
bottom of the page, below a horizontal line.

In Info, the reference mark for a footnote is a pair of parentheses
with the footnote number between them, like this: @samp{(1)}.  The
reference mark is followed by a cross-reference link to the footnote's
text.

In the HTML output, footnote references are marked with a small,
superscripted number which is rendered as a hypertext link to the
footnote text.

By the way, footnotes in the argument of an @code{@@item} command for
a @code{@@table} must be on the same line as the @code{@@item} (as
usual).  @xref{Two-column Tables}.


@node Footnote Styles
@subsection Footnote Styles

Info has two footnote styles, which determine where the text of the
footnote is located:

@itemize @bullet
@cindex @samp{@r{End}} node footnote style
@item
In the `End' node style, all the footnotes for a single node are
placed at the end of that node.  The footnotes are separated from the
rest of the node by a line of dashes with the word @samp{Footnotes}
within it.  Each footnote begins with an @samp{(@var{n})} reference
mark.

@need 700
@noindent
Here is an example of the Info output for a single footnote in the
end-of-node style:

@example
@group
--------- Footnotes ---------

(1)  Here is a sample footnote.
@end group
@end example

@cindex @samp{@r{Separate}} footnote style
@item
In the `Separate' node style, all the footnotes for a single
node are placed in an automatically constructed node of
their own.  In this style, a ``footnote reference'' follows
each @samp{(@var{n})} reference mark in the body of the
node.  The footnote reference is actually a cross reference
which you use to reach the footnote node.

The name of the node with the footnotes is constructed
by appending @w{@samp{-Footnotes}} to the name of the node
that contains the footnotes. (Consequently, the footnotes'
node for the @file{Footnotes} node is
@w{@file{Footnotes-Footnotes}}!)  The footnotes' node has an
`Up' node pointer that leads back to its parent node.

@noindent
Here is how the first footnote in this manual looks after being
formatted for Info in the separate node style:

@smallexample
@group
File: texinfo.info  Node: Overview-Footnotes, Up: Overview

(1) The first syllable of "Texinfo" is pronounced like "speck", not
"hex". @dots{}
@end group
@end smallexample
@end itemize

Unless your document has long and important footnotes (as in, say,
Gibbon's @cite{Decline and Fall @dots{}}), we recommend the @samp{end}
style, as it is simpler for readers to follow.

@findex footnotestyle
Use the @code{@@footnotestyle} command to specify an Info file's
footnote style.  Write this command at the beginning of a line followed
by an argument, either @samp{end} for the end node style or
@samp{separate} for the separate node style.

@need 700
For example,

@example
@@footnotestyle end
@end example
@noindent
or
@example
@@footnotestyle separate
@end example

Write an @code{@@footnotestyle} command before or shortly after the
end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file.  (You should
include any @code{@@footnotestyle} command between the start-of-header
and end-of-header lines, so the region formatting commands will format
footnotes as specified.)

In HTML, when the footnote style is @samp{end}, or if the output is
not split, footnotes are put at the end of the output.  If set to
@samp{separate}, and the output is split, they are placed in a
separate file.

@node Indices
@chapter Indices
@cindex Indices

Using Texinfo, you can generate indices without having to sort and
collate entries manually.  In an index, the entries are listed in
alphabetical order, together with information on how to find the
discussion of each entry.  In a printed manual, this information
consists of page numbers.  In an Info file, this information is a menu
entry leading to the first node referenced.

Texinfo provides several predefined kinds of index: an index
for functions, an index for variables, an index for concepts, and so
on.  You can combine indices or use them for other than their
canonical purpose.  Lastly, you can define your own new indices.

indices.

@cindex Entries, making index

When you are making index entries, it is good practice to think of the
different ways people may look for something.  Different people
@emph{do not} think of the same words when they look something up.  A
helpful index will have items indexed under all the different words
that people may use.  For example, one reader may think it obvious that
the two-letter names for indices should be listed under ``Indices,
two-letter names'', since the word ``Index'' is the general concept.
But another reader may remember the specific concept of two-letter
names and search for the entry listed as ``Two letter names for
indices''.  A good index will have both entries and will help both
readers.@refill

Like typesetting, the construction of an index is a highly skilled,
professional art, the subtleties of which are not appreciated until you
need to do it yourself.@refill

@xref{Printing Indices & Menus}, for information about printing an index
at the end of a book or creating an index menu in an Info file.@refill


@node Predefined Indices
@section Predefined Indices

Texinfo provides six predefined indices.  Here are their nominal
meanings, abbreviations, and the corresponding index entry commands:

@table @samp
@item cp
@cindex @code{cp} (concept) index
@findex cindex
(@code{@@cindex}) concept index, for general concepts.
@item fn
@cindex @code{fn} (function) index
@findex findex
(@code{@@findex}) function index, for function and function-like
names (such as entry points of libraries).
@item ky
@cindex @code{ky} (keystroke) index
@findex kindex
(@code{@@kindex}) keystroke index, for keyboard commands.
@item pg
@cindex @code{pg} (program) index
@findex pindex
(@code{@@pindex}) program index, for names of programs.
@item tp
@cindex @code{tp} (data type) index
@findex tindex
(@code{@@tindex}) data type index, for type names (such as structures
defined in header files).
@item vr
@cindex @code{vr} (variable) index
@findex vindex
(@code{@@vindex}) variable index, for variable names (such as global
variables of libraries).
@end table

@noindent
Not every manual needs all of these, and most manuals use only two or
three at most.  The present manual, for example, has two indices: a
concept index and an @@-command index (that is actually the function
index but is called a command index in the chapter heading).

You are not required to use the predefined indices strictly for their
canonical purposes.  For example, suppose you wish to index some C
preprocessor macros.  You could put them in the function index along
with actual functions, just by writing @code{@@findex} commands for
them; then, when you print the ``Function Index'' as an unnumbered
chapter, you could give it the title `Function and Macro Index' and
all will be consistent for the reader.

On the other hand, it is best not to stray too far from the meaning of
the predefined indices.  Otherwise, in the event that your text is
combined with other text from other manuals, the index entries will
not match up.  Instead, define your own new index (@pxref{New
Indices}).

We recommend having a single index in the final document whenever
possible, however many source indices you use, since then readers have
only one place to look.  Two or more source indices can be combined
into one output index using the @code{@@synindex} or
@code{@@syncodeindex} commands (@pxref{Combining Indices}).


@node Indexing Commands
@section Defining the Entries of an Index
@cindex Defining indexing entries
@cindex Index entries
@cindex Entries for an index
@cindex Specifying index entries
@cindex Creating index entries

The data to make an index come from many individual indexing commands
scattered throughout the Texinfo source file.  Each command says to add
one entry to a particular index; after formatting, the index will give
the current page number or node name as the reference.@refill

An index entry consists of an indexing command at the beginning of a
line followed, on the rest of the line, by the entry.@refill

For example, this section begins with the following five entries for
the concept index:@refill

@example
@@cindex Defining indexing entries
@@cindex Index entries, defining
@@cindex Entries for an index
@@cindex Specifying index entries
@@cindex Creating index entries
@end example

Each predefined index has its own indexing command---@code{@@cindex}
for the concept index, @code{@@findex} for the function index, and so
on, as listed in the previous section.

@cindex Writing index entries
@cindex Index entry writing
Concept index entries consist of text.  The best way to write an index
is to choose entries that are terse yet clear.  If you can do this,
the index often looks better if the entries are not capitalized, but
written just as they would appear in the middle of a sentence.
(Capitalize proper names and acronyms that always call for upper case
letters.)  This is the case convention we use in most GNU manuals'
indices.

If you don't see how to make an entry terse yet clear, make it longer
and clear---not terse and confusing.  If many of the entries are several
words long, the index may look better if you use a different convention:
to capitalize the first word of each entry.  But do not capitalize a
case-sensitive name such as a C or Lisp function name or a shell
command; that would be a spelling error.

Whichever case convention you use, use it consistently.

Entries in indices other than the concept index are symbol names in
programming languages, or program names; these names are usually
case-sensitive, so use upper and lower case as required for them.

Index entries should precede the visible material that is being
indexed.  For instance:

@example
@cindex hello
Hello, there!
@end example

@noindent Among other reasons, that way following indexing links (in
whatever context) ends up before the material, where readers want to
be, instead of after.

@c if an index command follows the material, there can be a spurious
@c space in the output, which can end up as a whole extra blank line
@c in TeX.  This is the glue between the last character in the
@c paragraph and the whatsit from the index.  The solution is to
@c comment out the space, as in:
@c     He said, "Hello, there!".@c
@c     @cindex hello

@cindex Index font types
By default, entries for a concept index are printed in a small roman
font and entries for the other indices are printed in a small
@code{@@code} font.  You may change the way part of an entry is
printed with the usual Texinfo commands, such as @code{@@file} for
file names (@pxref{Marking Text}), and @code{@@r} for the normal roman
font (@pxref{Fonts}).

@quotation Caution
Do not use a colon in an index entry.  In Info, a colon separates the
menu entry name from the node name, so a colon in the entry itself
confuses Info.  @xref{Menu Parts}, for more information about the
structure of a menu entry.
@end quotation


@node Combining Indices
@section Combining Indices
@cindex Combining indices
@cindex Indices, combining them

Sometimes you will want to combine two disparate indices such as
functions and concepts, perhaps because you have few enough entries
that a separate index would look silly.

You could put functions into the concept index by writing
@code{@@cindex} commands for them instead of @code{@@findex} commands,
and produce a consistent manual by printing the concept index with the
title `Function and Concept Index' and not printing the `Function
Index' at all; but this is not a robust procedure.  It works only if
your document is never included as part of another document that is
designed to have a separate function index; if your document were to
be included with such a document, the functions from your document and
those from the other would not end up together.  Also, to make your
function names appear in the right font in the concept index, you
would need to enclose every one of them between the braces of
@code{@@code}.

@end menu

@node syncodeindex
@subsection @code{@@syncodeindex}
@findex syncodeindex

When you want to combine functions and concepts into one index, you
should index the functions with @code{@@findex} and index the concepts
with @code{@@cindex}, and use the @code{@@syncodeindex} command to
redirect the function index entries into the concept index.@refill

The @code{@@syncodeindex} command takes two arguments; they are the name
of the index to redirect, and the name of the index to redirect it to.
The template looks like this:@refill

@example
@@syncodeindex @var{from} @var{to}
@end example

@cindex Predefined names for indices
@cindex Two letter names for indices
@cindex Indices, two letter names
@cindex Names for indices
For this purpose, the indices are given two-letter names:@refill

@table @samp
@item cp
concept index
@item fn
function index
@item vr
variable index
@item ky
key index
@item pg
program index
@item tp
data type index
@end table

Write an @code{@@syncodeindex} command before or shortly after the
end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file.  For example,
to merge a function index with a concept index, write the
following:@refill

@example
@@syncodeindex fn cp
@end example

@noindent
This will cause all entries designated for the function index to merge
in with the concept index instead.@refill

To merge both a variables index and a function index into a concept
index, write the following:@refill

@example
@group
@@syncodeindex vr cp
@@syncodeindex fn cp
@end group
@end example

@cindex Fonts for indices
The @code{@@syncodeindex} command puts all the entries from the `from'
index (the redirected index) into the @code{@@code} font, overriding
whatever default font is used by the index to which the entries are
now directed.  This way, if you direct function names from a function
index into a concept index, all the function names are printed in the
@code{@@code} font as you would expect.@refill

@node synindex
@subsection @code{@@synindex}
@findex synindex

The @code{@@synindex} command is nearly the same as the
@code{@@syncodeindex} command, except that it does not put the
`from' index  entries into the @code{@@code} font; rather it puts
them in the roman font.  Thus, you use @code{@@synindex} when you
merge a concept index into a function index.@refill

@node New Indices
@section Defining New Indices
@cindex Defining new indices
@cindex Indices, defining new
@cindex New index defining
@findex defindex
@findex defcodeindex

In addition to the predefined indices, you may use the
@code{@@defindex} and @code{@@defcodeindex} commands to define new
indices.  These commands create new indexing @@-commands with which
you mark index entries.  The @code{@@defindex} command is used like
this:

@example
@@defindex @var{name}
@end example

The name of an index should be a two letter word, such as @samp{au}.
For example:

@example
@@defindex au
@end example

This defines a new index, called the @samp{au} index.  At the same
time, it creates a new indexing command, @code{@@auindex}, that you
can use to make index entries.  Use this new indexing command just as
you would use a predefined indexing command.

For example, here is a section heading followed by a concept index
entry and two @samp{au} index entries.

@example
@@section Cognitive Semantics
@@cindex kinesthetic image schemas
@@auindex Johnson, Mark
@@auindex Lakoff, George
@end example

@noindent
(Evidently, @samp{au} serves here as an abbreviation for ``author''.)

In general, Texinfo constructs the new indexing command by
concatenating the name of the index with @samp{index}; thus, defining
an @samp{xy} index leads to the automatic creation of an
@code{@@xyindex} command.

Use the @code{@@printindex} command to print the index, as you do with
the predefined indices.  For example:

@example
@group
@@node Author Index
@@unnumbered Author Index

@@printindex au
@end group
@end example

The @code{@@defcodeindex} is like the @code{@@defindex} command,
except that, in the printed output, it prints entries in an
@code{@@code} font by default instead of a roman font.

You should define new indices before the end-of-header line of a
Texinfo file, and (of course) before any @code{@@synindex} or
@code{@@syncodeindex} commands (@pxref{Texinfo File Header}).

@node Inserting a Comma
@subsection Inserting `,' with @code{@@comma@{@}}
@cindex Commas, inserting
@findex comma

Ordinarily, a comma `,' is a normal character that can be simply typed
in your input where you need it.

However, Texinfo uses the comma as a special character in one uncommon
context: some commands, such as @code{@@acronym} (@pxref{acronym}) and
@code{@@xref} (@pxref{Cross References}), as well as user-defined
macros (@pxref{Defining Macros}), can take more than one argument.  In
these cases, the comma character is used to separate arguments.

Since a comma character would confuse Texinfo's parsing for these
commands, you must use the command @samp{@@comma@{@}} instead if you want
to pass an actual comma.  Here are some examples:

@example
@@acronym@{ABC, A Bizarre @@comma@{@}@}
@@xref@{Comma,, The @@comma@{@} symbol@}
@@mymac@{One argument@@comma@{@} containing a comma@}
@end example

Although @samp{@@comma@{@}} can be used nearly anywhere, there is no
need for it anywhere except in this unusual case.


@node Inserting Quote Characters
@section Inserting Quote Characters

@cindex Inserting quote characters
@cindex Quote characters, inserting

As explained in the early section on general Texinfo input conventions
(@pxref{Conventions}), Texinfo source files use the ASCII character
@code{`} (96 decimal) to produce a left quote (`), and ASCII @code{'}
(39 decimal) to produce a right quote (').  Doubling these input
characters (@code{``} and @code{''}) produces double quotes (`` and
'').  These are the conventions used by @TeX{}.

This works all right for text.  However, in examples of computer code,
readers are especially likely to cut and paste the text
verbatim---and, unfortunately, some document viewers will mangle these
characters.  (The free PDF reader @command{xpdf} works fine, but other
PDF readers, both free and nonfree, have problems.)

If this is a concern for your document, Texinfo provides two special
settings via @code{@@set}:

@table @code
@item @@set txicodequoteundirected
causes the output for the @code{'} character to be the undirected
single quote, like this:
@set txicodequoteundirected
@code{'}.
@clear txicodequoteundirected

@item @@set txicodequotebacktick
causes the output for the @code{`} character to be the standalone grave
accent, like this:
@set txicodequotebacktick
@code{`}.
@clear txicodequotebacktick

@end table

If you want these settings for only part of the document,
@code{@@clear} will restore the normal behavior, as in
@code{@@clear@tie{}txicodequoteundirected}.

These settings affect @code{@@code}, @code{@@example}, @code{@@samp},
@code{verb}, and @code{@@verbatim}; they do not affect @code{@@kbd}.

@subsection Not Ending a Sentence

@cindex Not ending a sentence
@cindex Sentence non-ending punctuation
@cindex Periods, inserting
Depending on whether a period or exclamation point or question mark is
inside or at the end of a sentence, slightly less or more space is
inserted after a period in a typeset manual.  Since it is not always
possible to determine automatically when a period ends a sentence,
special commands are needed in some circumstances.  Usually, Texinfo
can guess how to handle periods, so you do not need to use the special
commands; you just enter a period as you would if you were using a
typewriter: put two spaces after the period, question mark, or
exclamation mark that ends a sentence.

@findex <colon> @r{(suppress end-of-sentence space)}
Use the @code{@@:}@: command after a period, question mark,
exclamation mark, or colon that should not be followed by extra space.
For example, use @code{@@:}@: after periods that end abbreviations
which are not at the ends of sentences.

Also, when a parenthetical remark in the middle of a sentence (like
this one!)@: ends with a period, exclamation point, or question mark,
@code{@@:} should be used after the right parenthesis.

For example,

@example
foo vs.@@: (this?)@@: bar
foo vs. (this?) bar
@end example

@noindent
@ifnottex
produces
@end ifnottex
@iftex
produces the following.  If you look carefully at this printed output,
you will see a little extraneous space after the @samp{vs.}@: and
@samp{(this?)}@: in the second line.
@end iftex

@quotation
foo vs.@: bar (or?)@: baz@*
foo vs. bar (or?) baz@*
foo vs.@: bar@*
foo vs. bar
@end quotation

@noindent
@code{@@:} has no effect on the Info and HTML output.  In Docbook and
XML, the previous punctuation character (.?!:) is output as an entity
instead of as the normal character: @samp{&period; &quest; &excl;
&colon;}.  This gives further processors a chance to notice and not
add the usual extra space.

Do not put braces after @code{@@:} (or any non-alphabetic command).


@node Ending a Sentence
@subsection Ending a Sentence

@cindex Ending a Sentence
@cindex Sentence ending punctuation

@findex .  @r{(end of sentence)}
@findex ! @r{(end of sentence)}
@findex ? @r{(end of sentence)}
Use @code{@@.}@: instead of a period, @code{@@!}@: instead of an
exclamation point, and @code{@@?}@: instead of a question mark at the end
of a sentence that ends with a capital letter.  Otherwise, @TeX{}
will think the letter is an abbreviation and will not insert the correct
end-of-sentence spacing.  Here is an example:

@example
Give it to M.I.B. and to M.E.W@@.  Also, give it to R.J.C@@.
Give it to M.I.B. and to M.E.W.  Also, give it to R.J.C.

@iftex

Give it to M.I.B. and to M.E.W.  Also, give it to R.J.C.
@end quotation

In the Info file output, @code{@@.}@: is equivalent to a simple
@samp{.}; likewise for @code{@@!}@: and @code{@@?}@:.

The meanings of @code{@@:} and @code{@@.}@: in Texinfo are designed to
work well with the Emacs sentence motion commands (@pxref{Sentences,,,

Do not put braces after any of these commands.


@node Multiple Spaces
@subsection Multiple Spaces

@cindex Multiple spaces
@cindex Whitespace, inserting
@cindex Space, inserting horizontal
@findex <space>
@findex <tab>
@findex <newline>

Ordinarily, @TeX{} collapses multiple whitespace characters (space, tab,
and newline) into a single space.  Info output, on the other hand,
preserves whitespace as you type it, except for changing a newline into
a space; this is why it is important to put two spaces at the end of
sentences in Texinfo documents.

Occasionally, you may want to actually insert several consecutive
spaces, either for purposes of example (what your program does with
multiple spaces as input), or merely for purposes of appearance in
headings or lists.  Texinfo supports three commands:
@code{@@@kbd{SPACE}}, @code{@@@kbd{TAB}}, and @code{@@@kbd{NL}}, all of
which insert a single space into the output.  (Here,
@code{@@@kbd{SPACE}} represents an @samp{@@} character followed by a
space, i.e., @samp{@@ }, and @kbd{TAB} and @kbd{NL} represent the tab
character and end-of-line, i.e., when @samp{@@} is the last character on
a line.)

For example,
@example
Spacey@@ @@ @@ @@
example.
@end example

@noindent produces

@example
Spacey@ @ @ @
example.

Other possible uses of @code{@@@kbd{SPACE}} have been subsumed by

@node frenchspacing
@subsection @code{@@frenchspacing} @var{val}: Control sentence spacing
@findex frenchspacing
@cindex French spacing
@cindex Sentences, spacing after
@cindex Space, after sentences

In American typography, it is traditional and correct to put extra
space at the end of a sentence.  This is the default in Texinfo.  In
French typography (and many others), this extra space is wrong; all
spaces are uniform.

Therefore Texinfo provides the @code{@@frenchspacing} command to
control the spacing after punctuation.  It reads the rest of the line
as its argument, which must be the single word @samp{on} or @samp{off}
(always these words, regardless of the language) of the document.
Here is an example:

@example
@@frenchspacing on
This is text. Two sentences. Three sentences. French spacing.

@@frenchspacing off
This is text. Two sentences. Three sentences. Non-French spacing.
@end example

@noindent produces (there will be no difference in Info):

@frenchspacing on
This is text. Two sentences. Three sentences. French spacing.

@frenchspacing off
This is text. Two sentences. Three sentences. Non-French spacing.

@code{@@frenchspacing} mainly affects the printed output, including
the output after @code{@@.}, @code{@@!}, and @code{@@?} (@pxref{Ending
a Sentence}).

In Info, usually space characters in the input are written unaltered
to the output, and @code{@@frenchspacing} does not change this.  It
does change the one case where @command{makeinfo} outputs a space on
its own: when a sentence ends at a newline in the source.  Here's an
example:

@example
Some sentence.
Next sentence.
@end example

@noindent produces in Info output, with @code{@@frenchspacing off}
(the default), two spaces between the sentences:

@example
Some sentence.  Next sentence.
@end example

@noindent With @code{@@frenchspacing on}, @command{makeinfo} outputs
only a single space:

@example
Some sentence. Next sentence.
@end example

@code{@@frenchspacing} has no effect on the HTML or Docbook output;
for XML, it outputs a transliteration of itself (@pxref{Output
Formats}).


@node dmn
@subsection @code{@@dmn}@{@var{dimension}@}: Format a Dimension
@cindex Thin space between number, dimension
@cindex Dimension formatting
@cindex Format a dimension
@findex dmn

At times, you may want to write @samp{12@dmn{pt}} or
@samp{8.5@dmn{in}} with little or no space between the number and the
abbreviation for the dimension.  You can use the @code{@@dmn} command
to do this.  On seeing the command, @TeX{} inserts just enough space
for proper typesetting; the Info formatting commands insert no space
at all, since the Info file does not require it.

To use the @code{@@dmn} command, write the number and then follow it
immediately, with no intervening space, by @code{@@dmn}, and then by
the dimension within braces.  For example,

@example
A4 paper is 8.27@@dmn@{in@} wide.
@end example

@noindent
produces

@quotation
A4 paper is 8.27@dmn{in} wide.
@end quotation

Not everyone uses this style.  Some people prefer @w{@samp{8.27 in.@@:}}
or @w{@samp{8.27 inches}} to @samp{8.27@@dmn@{in@}} in the Texinfo file.
In these cases, however, the formatters may insert a line break between
the number and the dimension, so use @code{@@w} (@pxref{w}).  Also, if
you write a period after an abbreviation within a sentence, you should
write @samp{@@:} after the period to prevent @TeX{} from inserting extra
whitespace, as shown here.  @xref{Not Ending a Sentence}.


@node Inserting Accents
@section Inserting Accents

@cindex Inserting accents
@cindex Accents, inserting
@cindex Floating accents, inserting

Here is a table with the commands Texinfo provides for inserting
floating accents.  They all need an argument, the character to accent,
which can either be given in braces as usual (@code{@@'@{e@}}), or, as
a special case, the braces can be omitted, in which case the argument
is the next character (@code{@@'e}).  This is to make the source as
convenient as possible to type and read, since accented characters are
very common in some languages.

If the command is alphabetic, such as @code{@@dotaccent}, then there
must be a space between the command name and argument if braces are
not used.  If the command is non-alphabetic, such as @code{@@'}, then
there must @emph{not} be a space; the argument is the very next
character.

Exception: the argument to @code{@@tieaccent} must be enclosed in
braces (since it is two characters instead of one).

@findex documentencoding
To get the true accented characters output in Info, not just the ASCII
transliterations, it is necessary to specify @code{@@documentencoding}
with an encoding which supports the required characters
(@pxref{documentencoding,,@code{@@documentencoding}}).  In this case,
you can also use non-ASCII (e.g., pre-accented) characters in the
source file.

@node Inserting Quotation Marks
@section Inserting Quotation Marks
@cindex Inserting quotation marks
@cindex Quotation marks, inserting

@cindex Quotation characters (`'), in source
Use doubled single-quote characters to begin and end quotations:
@w{@t{`@w{}`@dots{}'@w{}'}}.  @TeX{} converts two single quotes to
left- and right-hand doubled quotation marks,
@c this comes out as "like this" in Info, which is just confusing.
@iftex
``like this'',
@end iftex
and Info converts doubled single-quote characters to ASCII
double-quotes: @w{@t{`@w{}`@dots{}'@w{}'}} becomes @w{@t{"@dots{}"}}.

You may occasionally need to produce two consecutive single quotes;
for example, in documenting a computer language such as Maxima where
@t{'@w{}'} is a valid command.  You can do this with the input
@t{'@@w@{@}'}; the empty @code{@@w} command stops the combination into
the double-quote characters.

@cindex Unicode quotation characters
@cindex Grave accent, vs. left quote
The left quote character (@t{`}, ASCII code 96) used in Texinfo is a
grave accent in ANSI and ISO character set standards.  We use it as a
quote character because that is how @TeX{} is set up, by default.

Texinfo supports several other quotation marks used in languages other
than English.  Below is a table with the commands Texinfo provides for
inserting quotation marks.

@findex documentencoding
@cindex UTF-8
@cindex ISO 8859-15
@cindex Latin 9
@cindex ISO 8859-1
@cindex Latin 1
In order to get the symbols for the quotation marks in encoded Info
output, it is necessary to specify @code{@@documentencoding UTF-8}.
(@xref{documentencoding,,@code{@@documentencoding}}.)  Double
guillemets are also present in ISO 8859-1 (aka Latin@tie{}1) and ISO
8859-15 (aka Latin@tie{}9).

@cindex European Computer Modern fonts
@cindex EC fonts
The standard @TeX{} fonts support the usual quotation marks used in
English (the ones produced with single and doubled ASCII
single-quotes).  For the other quotation marks, @TeX{} uses European
Computer Modern (EC) fonts (@file{ecrm1000} and other variants).
These fonts are freely available, of course; you can download them
from @url{http://@/www.ctan.org/@/tex-archive/@/fonts/ec}, among other
places.

@cindex CM-Super fonts
The free EC fonts are bitmap fonts created with Metafont.  Especially
for on-line viewing, Type@tie{}1 (vector) versions of the fonts are
preferable; these are available in the CM-Super font package
(@url{http://@/www.ctan.org/@/tex-archive/@/fonts/@/ps-type1/@/cm-super}).

@cindex Auk, bird species
For the double angle quotation marks, Adobe and @LaTeX{} glyph names
are also supported:  @code{@@guillemotleft} and
@code{@@guillemotright}.  These names are actually incorrect; a
``guillemot'' is a bird species (a type of auk).

Traditions for quotation mark usage vary to a great extent between
languages (@url{http://@/en.wikipedia.org/@/wiki/@/Quotation_mark%2C_non-English_usage@/#Overview}).
Texinfo does not provide commands for typesetting quotation marks
according to the numerous traditions.  Therefore, you have to choose
the commands appropriate for the language of your manual.  Sometimes
aliases (@pxref{alias,,@code{@@alias}}) can simplify the usage and
make the source code more readable.  For example, in German,
@code{@@quotedblbase} is used for the left double quote, and the right
double quote is actually @code{@@quotedblleft}, which is
counter-intuitive.  Thus, in this case the following aliases would be
convenient:

@example
@@alias lgqq = quotedblbase
@@alias rgqq = quotedblleft

Use the @code{@@dots@{@}} command to generate an ellipsis, which is
three dots in a row, appropriately spaced @dots{} like so.  Do
not simply write three periods in the input file; that would work for
the Info file output, but would produce the wrong amount of space
between the periods in the printed manual.

Similarly, the @code{@@enddots@{@}} command generates an
end-of-sentence ellipsis, which has different spacing afterwards,
@enddots{}  Look closely to see the difference.

letters.  In Info, it just looks like @samp{TeX}.

Similarly, use the @code{@@LaTeX@{@}} command to generate `@LaTeX{}',
which is even more special in printed manuals (and different from the
incorrect @code{La@@TeX@{@}}.  In Info, the result is just
@samp{LaTeX}.  (@LaTeX{} is another macro package built on top of
@TeX{}, very loosely analogous to Texinfo in that it emphasizes

The spelling of these commands are unusual among Texinfo commands in
that they use both uppercase and lowercase letters.

@node euro
@section @code{@@euro}@{@} (@euro{}): Euro Currency Symbol
@findex euro
@cindex Euro symbol

Use the @code{@@euro@{@}} command to generate `@euro{}'.  Where
possible, this is the symbol for the Euro currency, invented as part
of the European economic unification.  In plain Info, it is the word
@samp{Euro }.  A trailing space is included in the text
transliteration since typically no space is desired after the symbol,
so it would be inappropriate to have a space in the source document.

Texinfo cannot magically synthesize support for the Euro symbol where
the underlying system (fonts, software, whatever) does not support
it.  Therefore, in many cases it is preferable to use the word
``Euro''.  (In banking circles, the abbreviation for the Euro is EUR.)

@cindex ISO 8859-15
@cindex Latin 9
In order to get the Euro symbol in encoded Info output, for example,
it is necessary to specify @code{@@documentencoding ISO-8859-15}.
(@xref{documentencoding,,@code{@@documentencoding}}.)  The Euro symbol
is in ISO 8859-15 (aka Latin@tie{}9), and is @emph{not} in the more
widely-used and supported ISO 8859-1 (Latin@tie{}1).

@pindex feymr10
@cindex Euro font
The Euro symbol does not exist in the standard @TeX{} fonts (which
were designed before the Euro was legislated into existence).
Therefore, @TeX{} uses an additional font, named @code{feymr10} (along
with other variables).  It is freely available, of course; you can
download it from @url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/eurosym},
among other places.  The distribution includes installation
instructions.


@node pounds
@section @code{@@pounds}@{@} (@pounds{}): Pounds Sterling
@findex pounds
@cindex Pounds symbol

Use the @code{@@pounds@{@}} command to generate `@pounds{}'.  Where
possible, this is the symbol for the currency pounds sterling.  In
Info, it is a @samp{#}.


@node textdegree
@section @code{@@textdegree}@{@} (@textdegree{}): Degrees Symbol
@findex textdegree
@cindex Degree symbol

Use the @code{@@textdegree@{@}} command to generate `@textdegree{}'.
Where possible, this is the normal symbol for degrees.  In plain text
and Info output, it is an @samp{o}.


@node minus
@section @code{@@minus}@{@} (@minus{}): Inserting a Minus Sign
@findex minus
@cindex Minus sign

@cindex Em dash, compared to minus sign
@cindex Hyphen, compared to minus
Use the @code{@@minus@{@}} command to generate a minus sign.  In a
fixed-width font, this is a single hyphen, but in a proportional font,
the symbol is the customary length for a minus sign---a little longer
than a hyphen, shorter than an em-dash:

@display
@samp{@minus{}} is a minus sign generated with @samp{@@minus@{@}},

`-' is a hyphen generated with the character @samp{-},

`---' is an em-dash for text.
@end display

@noindent
In the fixed-width font used by Info, @code{@@minus@{@}} is the same
as a hyphen.

You should not use @code{@@minus@{@}} inside @code{@@code} or
@code{@@example} because the width distinction is not made in the
fixed-width font they use.

When you use @code{@@minus} to specify the mark beginning each entry in
an itemized list, you do not need to type the braces
(@pxref{itemize, , @code{@@itemize}}).


@node geq leq
@section @code{@@geq@{@}} (@geq{}) and @code{@@leq@{@}} (@leq{}): Inserting relations
@findex geq
@findex leq

Use the @code{@@geq@{@}} and @code{@@leq@{@}} commands to generate
greater-than-or-equal and less-than-equal-signs, `@geq{}' and
`@leq{}'.  In plain text and Info output, these are the ASCII
sequences @samp{>=} and @samp{<=}.


@node math
@section @code{@@math}: Inserting Mathematical Expressions
@findex math
@cindex Mathematical expressions
@cindex Formulas, mathematical

You can write a short mathematical expression with the @code{@@math}
command.  Write the mathematical expression between braces, like this:

@example
@@math@{(a + b)(a + b) = a^2 + 2ab + b^2@}
@end example

@iftex
@noindent This produces the following in @TeX{}:

@display
@math{(a + b)(a + b) = a^2 + 2ab + b^2}
@end display

@noindent and the following in other formats:
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@noindent This produces the following in Info and HTML:
@end ifnottex

@example
(a + b)(a + b) = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
@end example

The @code{@@math} command has no special effect on the Info and HTML
output.  @command{makeinfo} expands any @code{@@}-commands as usual,
but it does not try to produce good mathematical formatting in any
way.

However, as far as the @TeX{} output is concerned, plain @TeX{}
mathematical commands are allowed in @code{@@math}, starting with
@samp{\}, and the plain @TeX{} math characters like @samp{^} and
@samp{_} are also recognized.  In essence, @code{@@math} drops you
into plain @TeX{} math mode.

This allows you to conveniently write superscripts and subscripts (as
in the above example), and also to use all the plain @TeX{} math
control sequences for symbols, functions, and so on, and thus get
proper formatting in the @TeX{} output, at least.

It's best to use @samp{\} instead of @samp{@@} for any such
mathematical commands; otherwise, @command{makeinfo} will complain.
On the other hand, input with matching (but unescaped) braces, such as
@samp{k_@{75@}}, is allowed inside @code{@@math}, although
@command{makeinfo} would complain about the bare braces in regular
input.

Here's an example:

@example
@@math@{\sin 2\pi \equiv \cos 3\pi@}
@end example

@iftex
@noindent which looks like this in @TeX{}:
@display
@math{\sin 2\pi \equiv \cos 3\pi}
@end display

@noindent and
@end iftex
@noindent which looks like the input in Info and HTML:
@example
\sin 2\pi \equiv \cos 3\pi
@end example

@findex \ @r{(literal \ in @code{@@math})}
Since @samp{\} is an escape character inside @code{@@math}, you can use
@code{@@\} to get a literal backslash (@code{\\} will work in @TeX{},
but you'd get the literal @samp{\\} in Info).  @code{@@\} is not
defined outside of @code{@@math}, since a @samp{\} ordinarily produces a
literal @samp{\}.

@node Click Sequences

@cindex Sequence of clicks
@cindex GUI click sequence

@findex clicksequence
When documenting graphical interfaces, it is necessary to describe
sequences such as `Click on @samp{File}, then choose @samp{Open}, then
@dots{}'.  Texinfo offers commands @code{@@clicksequence} and
@code{click} to represent this, typically used like this:

@example
@dots{} @@clicksequence@{File @@click@{@} Open@} @dots{}
@end example

@noindent
which produces:

@display
@dots{} @clicksequence{File @click{} Open} @dots{}
@end display

@findex click
@findex arrow
The @code{@@click} command produces a simple right arrow (@samp{->} in
Info) by default; this glyph is also available independently via the
command @code{@@arrow@{@}}.

@findex clickstyle
You can change the glyph produced by @code{@@click} with the command
@code{@@clickstyle}, which takes a command name as its single argument
on the rest of the line, much like @code{@@itemize} and friends
(@pxref{itemize,,@code{@@itemize}}).  The command should produce a
glyph, and the usual empty braces @samp{@{@}} are omitted.  Here's an
example:

@example
@@clickstyle @@result
@dots{} @@clicksequence@{File @@click@{@} Open@} @dots{}
@end example

@noindent
now produces:

@display
@clickstyle @result
@dots{} @clicksequence{File @click{} Open} @dots{}
@end display


@node Glyphs
@section Glyphs for Examples
@cindex Glyphs
@cindex Examples, glyphs for

In Texinfo, code is often illustrated in examples that are delimited
by @code{@@example} and @code{@@end example}, or by @code{@@lisp} and
@code{@@end lisp}.  In such examples, you can indicate the results of
evaluation or an expansion using @samp{@result{}} or
@samp{@expansion{}}.  Likewise, there are commands to insert glyphs
to indicate
printed output, error messages, equivalence of expressions, and the
location of point.

The glyph-insertion commands do not need to be used within an example, but
most often they are.  Every  glyph-insertion command is followed by a pair of
left- and right-hand braces.@refill

@node result
@subsection @code{@@result@{@}} (@result{}): Indicating Evaluation
@cindex Result of an expression
@cindex Indicating evaluation
@cindex Evaluation glyph
@cindex Value of an expression, indicating
@findex result

Use the @code{@@result@{@}} command to indicate the result of
evaluating an expression.@refill

@iftex
The @code{@@result@{@}} command is displayed as @samp{@result{}} in
the printed output and as @samp{=>} in other formats.
@end iftex
@ifnottex
The @code{@@result@{@}} command is displayed as @samp{@result{}} in
Info and HTML and as a true double stemmed arrow in the printed output.
@end ifnottex

Thus, the following,

@lisp
(cdr '(1 2 3))
    @result{} (2 3)
@end lisp

@noindent
may be read as ``@code{(cdr '(1 2 3))} evaluates to @code{(2 3)}''.


@node expansion
@subsection @code{@@expansion@{@}} (@expansion{}): Indicating an Expansion
@cindex Expansion, indicating
@cindex Macro expansion, indicating
@findex expansion

When an expression is a macro call, it expands into a new expression.
You can indicate the result of the expansion with the
@code{@@expansion@{@}} command.@refill

@iftex
The @code{@@expansion@{@}} command is displayed as @samp{@expansion{}}
in the printed output and as @samp{==>} in other formats.
@end iftex
@ifnottex
The @code{@@expansion@{@}} command is displayed as @samp{@expansion{}}
in Info and HTML, and as a long arrow with a flat base in the printed
output.
@end ifnottex

@need 700
For example, the following

@example
@group
@@lisp
(third '(a b c))
    @@expansion@{@} (car (cdr (cdr '(a b c))))
    @@result@{@} c
@@end lisp
@end group
@end example

@noindent
produces

@lisp
@group
(third '(a b c))
    @expansion{} (car (cdr (cdr '(a b c))))
    @result{} c
@end group
@end lisp

@noindent
which may be read as:

@quotation
@code{(third '(a b c))} expands to @code{(car (cdr (cdr '(a b c))))};
the result of evaluating the expression is @code{c}.
@end quotation

@noindent
Often, as in this case, an example looks better if the
@code{@@expansion@{@}} and @code{@@result@{@}} commands are indented.


@node Print Glyph
@subsection @code{@@print@{@}} (@print{}): Indicating Printed Output
@cindex Printed output, indicating
@findex print

Sometimes an expression will print output during its execution.  You
can indicate the printed output with the @code{@@print@{@}} command.@refill

@iftex
The @code{@@print@{@}} command is displayed as @samp{-|} in Info and
HTML and as @samp{@print{}} in the printed output.
@end iftex
@ifnottex
The @code{@@print@{@}} command is displayed as @samp{@print{}} in Info
and HTML and (similarly) as a horizontal dash butting against a
vertical bar in the printed output.
@end ifnottex

In the following example, the printed text is indicated with
@samp{@print{}}, and the value of the expression follows on the
last line.

@lisp
@group
(progn (print 'foo) (print 'bar))
    @print{} foo
    @print{} bar
    @result{} bar
@end group
@end lisp

@noindent
In a Texinfo source file, this example is written as follows:

@lisp
@group
@@lisp
(progn (print 'foo) (print 'bar))
    @@print@{@} foo
    @@print@{@} bar
    @@result@{@} bar
@@end lisp
@end group
@end lisp


@node Error Glyph
@subsection @code{@@error@{@}} (@error{}): Indicating an Error Message
@cindex Error message, indicating
@findex error

A piece of code may cause an error when you evaluate it.  You can
designate the error message with the @code{@@error@{@}} command.@refill

@iftex
The @code{@@error@{@}} command is displayed as @samp{error-->} in Info
and HTML and as @samp{@error{}} in the printed output.
@end iftex
@ifnottex
The @code{@@error@{@}} command is displayed as @samp{@error{}} in Info
and HTML and as the word `error' in a box in the printed output.
@end ifnottex

@need 700
Thus,

@example
@@lisp
(+ 23 'x)
@@error@{@} Wrong type argument: integer-or-marker-p, x
@@end lisp
@end example

@noindent
produces

@lisp
(+ 23 'x)
@error{} Wrong type argument: integer-or-marker-p, x
@end lisp

@noindent
This indicates that the following error message is printed
when you evaluate the expression:

@lisp
Wrong type argument: integer-or-marker-p, x
@end lisp

@samp{@error{}} itself is not part of the error message.


@node Equivalence
@subsection @code{@@equiv@{@}} (@equiv{}): Indicating Equivalence
@cindex Equivalence, indicating
@findex equiv

Sometimes two expressions produce identical results.  You can indicate the
exact equivalence of two forms with the @code{@@equiv@{@}} command.@refill

@iftex
The @code{@@equiv@{@}} command is displayed as @samp{==} in Info and
HTML and as @samp{@equiv{}} in the printed output.
@end iftex
@ifnottex
The @code{@@equiv@{@}} command is displayed as @samp{@equiv{}} in Info
and HTML and as a standard mathematical equivalence sign (three
parallel horizontal lines) in the printed output.
@end ifnottex

Thus,

@example
@@lisp
(make-sparse-keymap) @@equiv@{@} (list 'keymap)
@@end lisp
@end example

@noindent
produces

@lisp
(make-sparse-keymap) @equiv{} (list 'keymap)
@end lisp

@noindent
This indicates that evaluating @code{(make-sparse-keymap)} produces
identical results to evaluating @code{(list 'keymap)}.


@node Point Glyph
@subsection @code{@@point@{@}} (@point{}): Indicating Point in a Buffer
@cindex Point, indicating in a buffer
@findex point

Sometimes you need to show an example of text in an Emacs buffer.  In
such examples, the convention is to include the entire contents of the
buffer in question between two lines of dashes containing the buffer
name.@refill

You can use the @samp{@@point@{@}} command to show the location of point
in the text in the buffer.  (The symbol for point, of course, is not
part of the text in the buffer; it indicates the place @emph{between}
two characters where point is located.)@refill

@iftex
The @code{@@point@{@}} command is displayed as @samp{-!-} in Info and
HTML and as @samp{@point{}} in the printed output.
@end iftex
@ifnottex
The @code{@@point@{@}} command is displayed as @samp{@point{}} in Info
and HTML and as a small five pointed star in the printed
output.
@end ifnottex

The following example shows the contents of buffer @file{foo} before
and after evaluating a Lisp command to insert the word @code{changed}.@refill

@example
@group
---------- Buffer: foo ----------
This is the @point{}contents of foo.
---------- Buffer: foo ----------

@end group
@end example

@example
@group
(insert "changed ")
    @result{} nil
---------- Buffer: foo ----------
This is the changed @point{}contents of foo.
---------- Buffer: foo ----------

@end group
@end example

In a Texinfo source file, the example is written like this:@refill

@example
@@example
---------- Buffer: foo ----------
This is the @@point@{@}contents of foo.
---------- Buffer: foo ----------

(insert "changed ")
    @@result@{@} nil
---------- Buffer: foo ----------
This is the changed @@point@{@}contents of foo.
---------- Buffer: foo ----------

@cindex Forcing line and page breaks
@cindex Making line and page breaks
@cindex Preventing line and page breaks

@cindex Line breaks
Usually, a Texinfo file is processed both by @TeX{} and by one of the
Info formatting commands.  Line, paragraph, or page breaks sometimes
occur in the `wrong' place in one or other form of output.  You must
ensure that text looks right both in the printed manual and in the
Info file.

@cindex White space, excessive
@cindex Page breaks
For example, in a printed manual, page breaks may occur awkwardly in
the middle of an example; to prevent this, you can hold text together
using a grouping command that keeps the text from being split across
two pages.  Conversely, you may want to force a page break where none
would occur normally.  Fortunately, problems like these do not often
arise.  When they do, use the break, break prevention, or pagination
commands.

@node Break Commands
@section Break Commands

The break commands create or allow line and paragraph breaks:

@table @code
@item @@*
Force a line break.

@item @@sp @var{n}
Skip @var{n} blank lines.

@item @@-
Insert a discretionary hyphen.

@item @@hyphenation@{@var{hy-phen-a-ted words}@}
Define hyphen points in @var{hy-phen-a-ted words}.
@end table

These commands hold text together on a single line:

@table @code
@item @@w@{@var{text}@}
Prevent @var{text} from being split and hyphenated across two lines.
@item @@tie@{@}
Insert a normal interword space at which a line break may not occur.
@end table
@iftex
@sp 1
@end iftex

The pagination commands apply only to printed output, since Info
files do not have pages.

@table @code
@item @@page
Start a new page in the printed manual.

@item @@group
Hold text together that must appear on one printed page.

@item @@need @var{mils}
Start a new printed page if not enough space on this one.
@end table


@node Line Breaks
@section @code{@@*} and @code{@@/}: Generate and Allow Line Breaks
@findex * @r{(force line break)}
@findex / @r{(allow line break)}
@cindex Line breaks
@cindex Breaks in a line
@cindex Force line break
@cindex Allow line break

The @code{@@*} command forces a line break in both the printed manual and
in Info.  The @code{@@/} command allows a line break (printed manual only).

Here is an example with @code{@@*}:

@example
This line @@* is broken @@*in two places.
@end example

@noindent produces

@example
@group
This line
is broken
in two places.
@end group
@end example

The @code{@@/} command can be useful within a url
(@pxref{uref,,@code{@@uref}}), which tend to be long and are otherwise
unbreakable.  For example:

@example
The official Texinfo home page is on the GNU web site:
@@uref@{http://www.gnu.org/@@/software/@@/gnu/@@/texinfo@}.
@end example

@noindent produces

@display
The official Texinfo home page is on the GNU web site:
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/@/software/@/gnu/@/texinfo}.
@end display

@noindent Without the @code{@@/} commands, @TeX{} would have nowhere to
break the line.  @code{@@/} has no effect in the online output.


@node - and hyphenation
@section @code{@@-} and @code{@@hyphenation}: Helping @TeX{} Hyphenate

@findex - @r{(discretionary hyphen)}
@findex hyphenation
@cindex Hyphenation, helping @TeX{} do
@cindex Fine-tuning, and hyphenation

Although @TeX{}'s hyphenation algorithm is generally pretty good, it
does miss useful hyphenation points from time to time.  (Or, far more
rarely, insert an incorrect hyphenation.)  So, for documents with an
unusual vocabulary or when fine-tuning for a printed edition, you may
wish to help @TeX{} out.  Texinfo supports two commands for this:

@table @code
@item @@-
Insert a discretionary hyphen, i.e., a place where @TeX{} can (but does
not have to) hyphenate.  This is especially useful when you notice an
overfull hbox is due to @TeX{} missing a hyphenation (@pxref{Overfull
hboxes}).  @TeX{} will not insert any hyphenation points itself into a
word containing @code{@@-}.

@item @@hyphenation@{@var{hy-phen-a-ted words}@}
Tell @TeX{} how to hyphenate @var{hy-phen-a-ted words}.  As shown, you
put a @samp{-} at each hyphenation point.  For example:
@example
@@hyphenation@{man-u-script man-u-scripts@}
@end example
@noindent @TeX{} only uses the specified hyphenation points when the
words match exactly, so give all necessary variants, such as plurals.
@end table

Info, HTML, and other non-@TeX{} output is not hyphenated, so none of
these commands have any effect there.


@node allowcodebreaks
@section @code{@@allowcodebreaks}: Control Line Breaks in @code{@@code}

@findex allowcodebreaks
@cindex Breaks, within @code{@@code}
@cindex -, breakpoint within @code{@@code}
@cindex Hyphen, breakpoint within @code{@@code}
@cindex Dash, breakpoint within @code{@@code}
@cindex _, breakpoint within @code{@@code}
@cindex Underscore, breakpoint within @code{@@code}

Ordinarily, @TeX{} will consider breaking lines at @samp{-} and
@samp{_} characters within @code{@@code} and related commands
(@pxref{code,,@code{@@code}}), more or less as if they were ``empty''
hyphenation points.

This is necessary as many manuals, especially for Lisp-family
languages, must document very long identifiers.  On the other hand,
other manuals don't have this problems, and you may not wish to allow
a line break at the underscore in, for example, @code{SIZE_MAX}, or
even worse, after any of the four underscores in @code{__typeof__}.

So Texinfo provides this command:

@example
@@allowcodebreaks false
@end example

@noindent to prevent @TeX{} from breaking at @samp{-} or @samp{_} within
@code{@@code}.  You can go back to allowing such breaks with
@code{@@allowcodebreaks true}.  Write these commands on lines by
themselves.

These commands can be given anywhere in the document.  For example,
you may have just one problematic paragraph where you need to turn off
the breaks, but want them in general, or vice versa.

This command has no effect in Info, HTML, and other non-@TeX{} output.


@node w
@section @code{@@w}@{@var{text}@}: Prevent Line Breaks
@findex w @r{(prevent line break)}
@cindex Line breaks, preventing

@code{@@w@{@var{text}@}} outputs @var{text} and prohibits line breaks
within @var{text}, for both @TeX{} and @command{makeinfo}.

@cindex Non-breakable space, fixed
@cindex Unbreakable space, fixed
Thus, you can use @code{@@w} to produce a non-breakable space, fixed at
the width of a normal interword space:

@example
@@w@{ @} @@w@{ @} @@w@{ @} indentation.
@end example

@noindent produces:

@display
@w{ } @w{ } @w{ } indentation.
@end display

The space from @code{@@w@{@w{ }@}}, as well as being non-breakable,
also will not stretch or shrink.  Sometimes that is what you want, for
instance if you're doing manual indenting.  However, usually you want
a normal interword space that does stretch and shrink (in the printed
output); see the @code{@@tie} command in the next section.

@cindex Hyphenation, preventing
You can also use the @code{@@w} command to prevent @TeX{} from
automatically hyphenating a long name or phrase that happens to fall
near the end of a line.  @command{makeinfo} does not ever hyphenate
words.

@cindex Keyword expansion, preventing
@cindex Version control keywords, preventing expansion of
@cindex $Id expansion, preventing
You can also use @code{@@w} to avoid unwanted keyword expansion in
source control systems.  For example, to literally write @t{@w{$}Id$}
in your document, use @code{@@w@{$@}Id$}.


@node tie
@section @code{@@tie@{@}}: Inserting an Unbreakable Space
@findex tie @r{(unbreakable interword space)}
@cindex Tied space
@cindex Non-breakable space, variable
@cindex Unbreakable space, variable

The @code{@@tie@{@}} command produces a normal interword space at which
a line break may not occur.  Always write it with following (empty)
braces, as usual for commands used within a paragraph.  Here's an
example:

@example
@@TeX@{@} was written by Donald E.@@tie@{@}Knuth.
@end example

@noindent produces:

@display
@TeX{} was written by Donald E.@tie{}Knuth.
@end display

There are two important differences between @code{@@tie@{@}} and
@code{@@w@{@w{ }@}}:

@itemize
@item
The space produced by @code{@@tie@{@}} will stretch and shrink slightly
along with the normal interword spaces in the paragraph; the space
produced by @code{@@w@{@w{ }@}} will not vary.

@item
@code{@@tie@{@}} allows hyphenation of the surrounding words, while
@code{@@w@{@w{ }@}} inhibits hyphenation of those words (for @TeX{}nical
reasons, namely that it produces an @samp{\hbox}).

@end itemize


@node sp
@section @code{@@sp} @var{n}: Insert Blank Lines
@findex sp @r{(line spacing)}
@cindex Space, inserting vertical
@cindex Blank lines
@cindex Line spacing

A line beginning with and containing only @code{@@sp @var{n}}
generates @var{n} blank lines of space in both the printed manual and
the Info file.  @code{@@sp} also forces a paragraph break.  For
example,

@example
@@sp 2
@end example

@noindent
generates two blank lines.

The @code{@@sp} command is most often used in the title page.@refill

@ignore
@c node br, page, sp, Breaks
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@c section @code{@@br}: Generate Paragraph Breaks
@findex br @r{(paragraph breaks)}
@cindex Paragraph breaks
@cindex Breaks in a paragraph

The @code{@@br} command forces a paragraph break.  It inserts a blank
line.  You can use the command within or at the end of a line.  If
used within a line, the @code{@@br@{@}} command must be followed by
left and right braces (as shown here) to mark the end of the
command.@refill

@need 700
For example,

@example
@group
This line @@br@{@}contains and is ended by paragraph breaks@@br
and is followed by another line.
@end group
@end example

@noindent
produces

@example
@group
This line

contains and is ended by paragraph breaks

and is followed by another line.
@end group
@end example

The @code{@@br} command is seldom used.
@end ignore


@node page
@section @code{@@page}: Start a New Page
@cindex Page breaks
@findex page

A line containing only @code{@@page} starts a new page in a printed
manual.  In other formats, without the concept of pages, it starts a
new paragraph.  An @code{@@page} command is often used in the
@code{@@titlepage} section of a Texinfo file to start the copyright
page.


@node group
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section @code{@@group}: Prevent Page Breaks
@cindex Group (hold text together vertically)
@cindex Holding text together vertically
@cindex Vertically holding text together
@findex group

The @code{@@group} command (on a line by itself) is used inside an
@code{@@example} or similar construct to begin an unsplittable vertical
group, which will appear entirely on one page in the printed output.
The group is terminated by a line containing only @code{@@end group}.
These two lines produce no output of their own, and in the Info file
output they have no effect at all.@refill

@c Once said that these environments
@c turn off vertical spacing between ``paragraphs''.
@c Also, quotation used to work, but doesn't in texinfo-2.72
Although @code{@@group} would make sense conceptually in a wide
variety of contexts, its current implementation works reliably only
within @code{@@example} and variants, and within @code{@@display},
@code{@@format}, @code{@@flushleft} and @code{@@flushright}.
@xref{Quotations and Examples}.  (What all these commands have in
common is that each line of input produces a line of output.)  In
other contexts, @code{@@group} can cause anomalous vertical
spacing.@refill

@need 750
This formatting requirement means that you should write:

@example
@group
@@example
@@group
@dots{}
@@end group
@@end example
@end group
@end example

@noindent
with the @code{@@group} and @code{@@end group} commands inside the
@code{@@example} and @code{@@end example} commands.

The @code{@@group} command is most often used to hold an example
together on one page.  In this Texinfo manual, more than 100 examples
contain text that is enclosed between @code{@@group} and @code{@@end
group}.

If you forget to end a group, you may get strange and unfathomable
error messages when you run @TeX{}.  This is because @TeX{} keeps
trying to put the rest of the Texinfo file onto the one page and does
not start to generate error messages until it has processed
considerable text.  It is a good rule of thumb to look for a missing
@code{@@end group} if you get incomprehensible error messages in
@TeX{}.@refill

@node need
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section @code{@@need @var{mils}}: Prevent Page Breaks
@cindex Need space at page bottom
@findex need

@node Definition Commands
@chapter Definition Commands
@cindex Definition commands

The @code{@@deffn} command and the other @dfn{definition commands}
enable you to describe functions, variables, macros, commands, user
options, special forms and other such artifacts in a uniform
format.@refill

In the Info file, a definition causes the entity
category---`Function', `Variable', or whatever---to appear at the
beginning of the first line of the definition, followed by the
entity's name and arguments.  In the printed manual, the command
causes @TeX{} to print the entity's name and its arguments on the left
margin and print the category next to the right margin.  In both
output formats, the body of the definition is indented.  Also, the
name of the entity is entered into the appropriate index:
@code{@@deffn} enters the name into the index of functions,
@code{@@defvr} enters it into the index of variables, and so
on (@pxref{Predefined Indices}).

A manual need not and should not contain more than one definition for
a given name.  An appendix containing a summary should use
@code{@@table} rather than the definition commands.@refill

@node Def Cmd Template
@section The Template for a Definition
@cindex Definition template
@cindex Template for a definition

The @code{@@deffn} command is used for definitions of entities that
resemble functions.  To write a definition using the @code{@@deffn}
command, write the @code{@@deffn} command at the beginning of a line
and follow it on the same line by the category of the entity, the name
of the entity itself, and its arguments (if any).  Then write the body
of the definition on succeeding lines.  (You may embed examples in the
body.)  Finally, end the definition with an @code{@@end deffn} command
written on a line of its own.

The other definition commands follow the same format: a line with the
@code{@@def@dots{}} command and whatever arguments are appropriate for
that command; the body of the definition; and a corresponding
@code{@@end} line.

The template for a definition looks like this:

@example
@group
@@deffn @var{category} @var{name} @var{arguments}@dots{}
@var{body-of-definition}
@@end deffn
@end group
@end example

@need 700
@noindent
For example,

@example
@group
@@deffn Command forward-word count
This command moves point forward @@var@{count@} words
(or backward if @@var@{count@} is negative). @dots{}
@@end deffn
@end group
@end example

@noindent
produces

@quotation
@deffn Command forward-word count
This command moves point forward @var{count} words
(or backward if @var{count} is negative). @dots{}
@end deffn
@end quotation

Capitalize the category name like a title.  If the name of the
category contains spaces, as in the phrase `Interactive Command',
enclose it in braces.  For example:

@example
@group
@@deffn @{Interactive Command@} isearch-forward
@dots{}
@@end deffn
@end group
@end example

@noindent
Otherwise, the second word will be mistaken for the name of the
entity.  As a general rule, when any of the arguments in the heading
line @emph{except} the last one are more than one word, you need to
enclose them in braces.  This may also be necessary if the text
contains commands, for example, @samp{@{declaraci@@'on@}} if you are
writing in Spanish.

Some of the definition commands are more general than others.  The
@code{@@deffn} command, for example, is the general definition command
for functions and the like---for entities that may take arguments.
When you use this command, you specify the category to which the
entity belongs.  Three predefined, specialized variations
(@code{@@defun}, @code{@@defmac}, and @code{@@defspec}) specify the
category for you: ``Function'', ``Macro'', and ``Special Form''
respectively.  (In Lisp, a special form is an entity much like a
function.)  Similarly, the general @code{@@defvr} command is
accompanied by several specialized variations for describing
particular kinds of variables.

@xref{Sample Function Definition}, for a detailed example of a
function definition, including the use of @code{@@example} inside the
definition.

@cindex Macros in definition commands
Unfortunately, due to implementation difficulties, macros are not expanded
in @code{@@deffn} and all the other definition commands.


@node Def Cmd Continuation Lines
@section Definition Command Continuation Lines
@cindex Continuation lines in definition commands
@cindex Definition command headings, continuing
@cindex @samp{@@} as continuation in definition commands

The heading line of a definition command can get very long.
Therefore, Texinfo has a special syntax allowing them to be continued
over multiple lines of the source file: a lone @samp{@@} at the end of
each line to be continued.  Here's an example:

@example
@@defun fn-name @@
  arg1 arg2 arg3
This is the basic continued defun.
@@end defun
@end example

@noindent produces:

@defun fn-name @
  arg1 arg2 arg3
This is the basic continued defun.
@end defun

@noindent
As you can see, the continued lines are combined, as if they had been
typed on one source line.

Although this example only shows a one-line continuation,
continuations may extend over any number of lines; simply put an
@code{@@} at the end of each line to be continued.

The @code{@@} character does not have to be the last character on the
physical line: whitespace is allowed (and ignored) afterwards.

@cindex Whitespace, collapsed around continuations
@cindex Collapsing whitespace around continuations
In general, any number of spaces or tabs around the @code{@@}
continuation character, both on the line with the @code{@@} and on the
continued line, are collapsed into a single space.  There is one
exception: the Texinfo processors will not fully collapse whitespace
around a continuation inside braces.  For example:

@example
@@deffn @{Category @@
  Name@} @dots{}
@end example

@noindent The output (not shown) has excess space between `Category'
and `Name'.  In this case, simply elide any unwanted whitespace in
your input, or put the continuation @code{@@} outside braces.

@code{@@} does not (currently) function as a continuation character in
@emph{any} other context.  Ordinarily, @samp{@@} followed by a
whitespace character (space, tab, newline) produces a normal interword
space (@pxref{Multiple Spaces}).


@node Optional Arguments
@section Optional and Repeated Arguments
@cindex Optional and repeated arguments
@cindex Repeated and optional arguments
@cindex Arguments, repeated and optional
@cindex Syntax, optional & repeated arguments
@cindex Meta-syntactic chars for arguments

Some entities take optional or repeated arguments, which may be
specified by a distinctive glyph that uses square brackets and
ellipses.  For @w{example}, a special form often breaks its argument list
into separate arguments in more complicated ways than a
straightforward function.

@c This is consistent with Emacs Lisp Reference manual
An argument enclosed within square brackets is optional.
Thus, [@var{optional-arg}] means that @var{optional-arg} is optional.
An argument followed by an ellipsis is optional
and may be repeated more than once.
@c This is consistent with Emacs Lisp Reference manual
Thus, @var{repeated-args}@samp{@dots{}} stands for zero or more
arguments.  Parentheses are used when several arguments are grouped
into additional levels of list structure in Lisp.

Here is the @code{@@defspec} line of an example of an imaginary
special form:

@quotation
@defspec foobar (@var{var} [@var{from} @var{to} [@var{inc}]]) @var{body}@dots{}
@end defspec
@tex
\vskip \parskip
@end tex
@end quotation

@noindent
In this example, the arguments @var{from} and @var{to} are optional,
but must both be present or both absent.  If they are present,
@var{inc} may optionally be specified as well.  These arguments are
grouped with the argument @var{var} into a list, to distinguish them
from @var{body}, which includes all remaining elements of the
form.@refill

In a Texinfo source file, this @code{@@defspec} line is written like
this (except it would not be split over two lines, as it is in this
example).@refill

@example
@group
@@defspec foobar (@@var@{var@} [@@var@{from@} @@var@{to@}
    [@@var@{inc@}]]) @@var@{body@}@@dots@{@}
@end group
@end example

@noindent
The function is listed in the Command and Variable Index under
@samp{foobar}.@refill


@node deffnx
@section Two or More `First' Lines
@cindex Two `First' Lines for @code{@@deffn}
@cindex Grouping two definitions together
@cindex Definitions grouped together
@findex deffnx

To create two or more `first' or header lines for a definition, follow
the first @code{@@deffn} line by a line beginning with @code{@@deffnx}.
The @code{@@deffnx} command works exactly like @code{@@deffn}
except that it does not generate extra vertical white space between it
and the preceding line.@refill

@need 1000
For example,

@example
@group
@@deffn @{Interactive Command@} isearch-forward
@@deffnx @{Interactive Command@} isearch-backward
These two search commands are similar except @dots{}
@@end deffn
@end group
@end example

@noindent
produces

@deffn {Interactive Command} isearch-forward
@deffnx {Interactive Command} isearch-backward
These two search commands are similar except @dots{}
@end deffn

Each definition command has an `x' form: @code{@@defunx},
@code{@@defvrx}, @code{@@deftypefunx}, etc.

The `x' forms work similarly to @code{@@itemx} (@pxref{itemx}).


@node Def Cmds in Detail
@section The Definition Commands

Texinfo provides more than a dozen definition commands, all of which
are described in this section.@refill

The definition commands automatically enter the name of the entity in
the appropriate index: for example, @code{@@deffn}, @code{@@defun},
and @code{@@defmac} enter function names in the index of functions;
@code{@@defvr} and @code{@@defvar} enter variable names in the index
of variables.@refill

Although the examples that follow mostly illustrate Lisp, the commands
can be used for other programming languages.@refill

@node Functions Commands
@subsection Functions and Similar Entities

This section describes the commands for describing functions and similar
entities:@refill

@table @code
@findex deffn
@item @@deffn @var{category} @var{name} @var{arguments}@dots{}
The @code{@@deffn} command is the general definition command for
functions, interactive commands, and similar entities that may take
arguments.  You must choose a term to describe the category of entity
being defined; for example, ``Function'' could be used if the entity is
a function.  The @code{@@deffn} command is written at the beginning of a
line and is followed on the same line by the category of entity being
described, the name of this particular entity, and its arguments, if
any.  Terminate the definition with @code{@@end deffn} on a line of its
own.@refill

@need 750
For example, here is a definition:

@example
@group
@@deffn Command forward-char nchars
Move point forward @@var@{nchars@} characters.
@@end deffn
@end group
@end example

@noindent
This shows a rather terse definition for a ``command'' named
@code{forward-char} with one argument, @var{nchars}.

@code{@@deffn} prints argument names such as @var{nchars} in slanted
type in the printed output, because we think of these names as
metasyntactic variables---they stand for the actual argument values.
Within the text of the description, however, write an argument name
explicitly with @code{@@var} to refer to the value of the argument.
In the example above, we used @samp{@@var@{nchars@}} in this way.

In the unusual case when an argument name contains @samp{--}, or
another character sequence which is treated specially
(@pxref{Conventions}), use @code{@@var} around the argument.  This
causes the name to be printed in slanted typewriter, instead of the
regular slanted font, exactly as input.
@c except for ?` and !`, but we won't explain that.

The template for @code{@@deffn} is:

@example
@group
@@deffn @var{category} @var{name} @var{arguments}@dots{}
@var{body-of-definition}
@@end deffn
@end group
@end example

@findex defun
@item @@defun @var{name} @var{arguments}@dots{}
The @code{@@defun} command is the definition command for functions.
@code{@@defun} is equivalent to @samp{@@deffn Function @dots{}}.
Terminate the definition with @code{@@end defun} on a line of its own.
Thus, the template is:

@example
@group
@@defun @var{function-name} @var{arguments}@dots{}
@var{body-of-definition}
@@end defun
@end group
@end example

@findex defmac
@item @@defmac @var{name} @var{arguments}@dots{}
The @code{@@defmac} command is the definition command for macros.
@code{@@defmac} is equivalent to @samp{@@deffn Macro @dots{}} and
works like @code{@@defun}.

@findex defspec
@item @@defspec @var{name} @var{arguments}@dots{}
The @code{@@defspec} command is the definition command for special
forms.  (In Lisp, a special form is an entity much like a function,
@pxref{Special Forms,,, elisp, GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual}.)
@code{@@defspec} is equivalent to @samp{@@deffn @{Special Form@}
@dots{}} and works like @code{@@defun}.
@end table

All these commands create entries in the index of functions.


@node Variables Commands
@subsection Variables and Similar Entities

Here are the commands for defining variables and similar
entities:@refill

@table @code
@findex defvr
@item @@defvr @var{category} @var{name}
The @code{@@defvr} command is a general definition command for
something like a variable---an entity that records a value.  You must
choose a term to describe the category of entity being defined; for
example, ``Variable'' could be used if the entity is a variable.
Write the @code{@@defvr} command at the beginning of a line and
follow it on the same line by the category of the entity and the
name of the entity.

Capitalize the category name like a title.  If the name of the category
contains spaces, as in the name ``User Option'', enclose it in braces.
Otherwise, the second word will be mistaken for the name of the entity.
For example,

@example
@group
@@defvr @{User Option@} fill-column
This buffer-local variable specifies
the maximum width of filled lines.
@dots{}
@@end defvr
@end group
@end example

Terminate the definition with @code{@@end defvr} on a line of its
own.@refill

The template is:

@example
@group
@@defvr @var{category} @var{name}
@var{body-of-definition}
@@end defvr
@end group
@end example

@code{@@defvr} creates an entry in the index of variables for @var{name}.

@findex defvar
@item @@defvar @var{name}
The @code{@@defvar} command is the definition command for variables.
@code{@@defvar} is equivalent to @samp{@@defvr Variable
@dots{}}.@refill

@need 750
For example:

@example
@group
@@defvar kill-ring
@dots{}
@@end defvar
@end group
@end example

The template is:

@example
@group
@@defvar @var{name}
@var{body-of-definition}
@@end defvar
@end group
@end example

@code{@@defvar} creates an entry in the index of variables for
@var{name}.@refill

@findex defopt
@item @@defopt @var{name}
@cindex User options, marking
The @code{@@defopt} command is the definition command for @dfn{user
options}, i.e., variables intended for users to change according to
taste; Emacs has many such (@pxref{Variables,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs
Manual}).  @code{@@defopt} is equivalent to @samp{@@defvr @{User
Option@} @dots{}} and works like @code{@@defvar}.  It creates an entry
in the index of variables.
@end table


@node Typed Functions
@subsection Functions in Typed Languages

The @code{@@deftypefn} command and its variations are for describing
functions in languages in which you must declare types of variables and
functions, such as C and C++.

@table @code
@findex deftypefn
@item @@deftypefn @var{category} @var{data-type} @var{name} @var{arguments}@dots{}
The @code{@@deftypefn} command is the general definition command for
functions and similar entities that may take arguments and that are
typed.  The @code{@@deftypefn} command is written at the beginning of
a line and is followed on the same line by the category of entity
being described, the type of the returned value, the name of this
particular entity, and its arguments, if any.@refill

@need 800
@noindent
For example,

@example
@group
@@deftypefn @{Library Function@} int foobar
  (int @@var@{foo@}, float @@var@{bar@})
@dots{}
@@end deftypefn
@end group
@end example

@need 1000
@noindent
(where the text before the ``@dots{}'', shown above as two lines, would
actually be a single line in a real Texinfo file) produces the following
in Info:

@smallexample
@group
-- Library Function: int foobar (int FOO, float BAR)
@dots{}
@end group
@end smallexample
@iftex

In a printed manual, it produces:

@quotation
@deftypefn {Library Function} int foobar (int @var{foo}, float @var{bar})
@dots{}
@end deftypefn
@end quotation
@end iftex

This means that @code{foobar} is a ``library function'' that returns an
@code{int}, and its arguments are @var{foo} (an @code{int}) and
@var{bar} (a @code{float}).@refill

Since in typed languages, the actual names of the arguments are
typically scattered among data type names and keywords, Texinfo cannot
find them without help.  You can either (a)@tie{}write everything
as straight text, and it will be printed in slanted type; (b)@tie{}use
@code{@@var} for the variable names, which will uppercase the
variable names in Info and use the slanted typewriter font in printed
output; (c)@tie{}use @code{@@var} for the variable names and
@code{@@code} for the type names and keywords, which will be dutifully
obeyed.

The template for @code{@@deftypefn} is:@refill

@example
@group
@@deftypefn @var{category} @var{data-type} @var{name} @var{arguments} @dots{}
@var{body-of-description}
@@end deftypefn
@end group
@end example

@noindent
Note that if the @var{category} or @var{data type} is more than one
word then it must be enclosed in braces to make it a single argument.@refill

If you are describing a procedure in a language that has packages,
such as Ada, you might consider using @code{@@deftypefn} in a manner
somewhat contrary to the convention described in the preceding
paragraphs.  For example:

@example
@group
@@deftypefn stacks private push @@
       (@@var@{s@}:in out stack; @@
       @@var@{n@}:in integer)
@dots{}
@@end deftypefn
@end group
@end example

@noindent
(The @code{@@deftypefn} arguments are shown using continuations
(@pxref{Def Cmd Continuation Lines}), but could be on a single line in
a real Texinfo file.)

In this instance, the procedure is classified as belonging to the
package @code{stacks} rather than classified as a `procedure' and its
data type is described as @code{private}.  (The name of the procedure
is @code{push}, and its arguments are @var{s} and @var{n}.)@refill

@code{@@deftypefn} creates an entry in the index of functions for
@var{name}.

@item @@deftypefun @var{data-type} @var{name} @var{arguments}@dots{}
@findex deftypefun
The @code{@@deftypefun} command is the specialized definition command
for functions in typed languages.  The command is equivalent to
@samp{@@deftypefn Function @dots{}}.  The template is:

@example
@group
@@deftypefun @var{type} @var{name} @var{arguments}@dots{}
@var{body-of-description}
@@end deftypefun
@end group
@end example

@code{@@deftypefun} creates an entry in the index of functions for
@var{name}.

@end table


@node Typed Variables
@subsection Variables in Typed Languages

Variables in typed languages are handled in a manner similar to
functions in typed languages.  @xref{Typed Functions}.  The general
definition command @code{@@deftypevr} corresponds to
@code{@@deftypefn} and the specialized definition command
@code{@@deftypevar} corresponds to @code{@@deftypefun}.@refill

@table @code
@findex deftypevr
@item @@deftypevr @var{category} @var{data-type} @var{name}
The @code{@@deftypevr} command is the general definition command for
something like a variable in a typed language---an entity that records
a value.  You must choose a term to describe the category of the
entity being defined; for example, ``Variable'' could be used if the
entity is a variable.@refill

The @code{@@deftypevr} command is written at the beginning of a line
and is followed on the same line by the category of the entity

These commands create entries in the index of variables.

@node Data Types
@subsection Data Types

Here is the command for data types:@refill

@table @code
@findex deftp
@item @@deftp @var{category} @var{name} @var{attributes}@dots{}
The @code{@@deftp} command is the generic definition command for data
types.  The command is written at the beginning of a line and is
followed on the same line by the category, by the name of the type
(which is a word like @code{int} or @code{float}), and then by names of
attributes of objects of that type.  Thus, you could use this command
for describing @code{int} or @code{float}, in which case you could use
@code{data type} as the category.  (A data type is a category of
certain objects for purposes of deciding which operations can be
performed on them.)@refill

In Lisp, for example,  @dfn{pair} names a particular data
type, and an object of that type has two slots called the
@sc{car} and the @sc{cdr}.  Here is how you would write the first line
of a definition of @code{pair}.@refill

@example

@node Abstract Objects
@subsection Object-Oriented Programming

@cindex Object-oriented programming

Here are the commands for formatting descriptions about abstract
objects, such as are used in object-oriented programming.  A class is
a defined type of abstract object.  An instance of a class is a
particular object that has the type of the class.  An instance
variable is a variable that belongs to the class but for which each
instance has its own value.

@node Object-Oriented Variables
@subsubsection Object-Oriented Variables

@cindex Variables, object-oriented

These commands allow you to define different sorts of variables in
object-oriented programming languages.

@table @code
@item @@defcv @var{category} @var{class} @var{name}
@findex defcv
The @code{@@defcv} command is the general definition command for
variables associated with classes in object-oriented programming.  The
@code{@@defcv} command is followed by three arguments: the category of
thing being defined, the class to which it belongs, and its
name.  For instance:

@example
@group
@@defcv @{Class Option@} Window border-pattern
@dots{}
@@end defcv
@end group
@end example

@noindent produces:
@defcv {Class Option} Window border-pattern
@dots{}
@end defcv

@code{@@defcv} creates an entry in the index of variables.

@item @@deftypecv @var{category} @var{class} @var{data-type} @var{name}
@findex deftypecv
The @code{@@deftypecv} command is the definition command for typed
class variables in object-oriented programming.  It is analogous to
@code{@@defcv} with the addition of the @var{data-type} parameter to
specify the type of the instance variable.  Ordinarily, the data type
is a programming language construct that should be marked with
@code{@@code}. For instance:

@example
@group
@@deftypecv @{Class Option@} Window @@code@{int@} border-pattern
@dots{}
@@end deftypecv
@end group
@end example

@noindent produces:

@deftypecv {Class Option} Window @code{int} border-pattern
@dots{}
@end deftypecv

@code{@@deftypecv} creates an entry in the index of variables.

@item @@defivar @var{class} @var{name}
@findex defivar
The @code{@@defivar} command is the definition command for instance
variables in object-oriented programming.  @code{@@defivar} is
equivalent to @samp{@@defcv @{Instance Variable@} @dots{}}.  For
instance:

@example
@group
@@defivar Window border-pattern
@dots{}
@@end defivar
@end group
@end example

@noindent produces:

@defivar Window border-pattern

@code{@@defivar} creates an entry in the index of variables.

@item @@deftypeivar @var{class} @var{data-type} @var{name}
@findex deftypeivar
The @code{@@deftypeivar} command is the definition command for typed
instance variables in object-oriented programming.  It is analogous to
@code{@@defivar} with the addition of the @var{data-type} parameter to
specify the type of the instance variable.  Ordinarily, the data type
is a programming language construct that should be marked with
@code{@@code}. For instance:

@example
@group
@@deftypeivar Window @@code@{int@} border-pattern
@dots{}
@@end deftypeivar
@end group
@end example

@noindent produces:

@deftypeivar Window @code{int} border-pattern
@dots{}
@end deftypeivar

@code{@@deftypeivar} creates an entry in the index of variables.

@node Object-Oriented Methods
@subsubsection Object-Oriented Methods

@cindex Methods, object-oriented

These commands allow you to define different sorts of function-like
entities resembling methods in object-oriented programming languages.
These entities take arguments, as functions do, but are associated with
particular classes of objects.

@table @code

@findex defop
@item @@defop @var{category} @var{class} @var{name} @var{arguments}@dots{}
The @code{@@defop} command is the general definition command for these
method-like entities.

For example, some systems have constructs called @dfn{wrappers} that
are associated with classes as methods are, but that act more like
macros than like functions.  You could use @code{@@defop Wrapper} to
describe one of these.@refill

Sometimes it is useful to distinguish methods and @dfn{operations}.
You can think of an operation as the specification for a method.
Thus, a window system might specify that all window classes have a
method named @code{expose}; we would say that this window system
defines an @code{expose} operation on windows in general.  Typically,
the operation has a name and also specifies the pattern of arguments;
all methods that implement the operation must accept the same
arguments, since applications that use the operation do so without
knowing which method will implement it.@refill

Often it makes more sense to document operations than methods.  For
example, window application developers need to know about the
@code{expose} operation, but need not be concerned with whether a
given class of windows has its own method to implement this operation.
To describe this operation, you would write:@refill

@example
@@defop Operation windows expose
@end example

The @code{@@defop} command is written at the beginning of a line and
is followed on the same line by the overall name of the category of
operation, the name of the class of the operation, the name of the
operation, and its arguments, if any.@refill

The template is:
@example
@group
@@defop @var{category} @var{class} @var{name} @var{arguments}@dots{}
@var{body-of-definition}
@@end defop
@end group
@end example

@code{@@defop} creates an entry, such as `@code{expose} on
@code{windows}', in the index of functions.@refill

@findex deftypeop
@item @@deftypeop @var{category} @var{class} @var{data-type} @var{name} @var{arguments}@dots{}
The @code{@@deftypeop} command is the definition command for typed
operations in object-oriented programming.  It is similar to
@code{@@defop} with the addition of the @var{data-type} parameter to
specify the return type of the method.  @code{@@deftypeop} creates an
entry in the index of functions.

@item @@defmethod @var{class} @var{name} @var{arguments}@dots{}
@findex defmethod
The @code{@@defmethod} command is the definition command for methods
in object-oriented programming.  A method is a kind of function that
implements an operation for a particular class of objects and its
subclasses.
@ignore
@c ADR: Who cares?!?
@c KB: Oh, I don't know, I think this info is crucial!
In the Lisp Machine, methods actually were functions, but
they were usually defined with @code{defmethod}.
@end ignore

@code{@@defmethod} is equivalent to @samp{@@defop Method @dots{}}.
The command is written at the beginning of a line and is followed by
the name of the class of the method, the name of the method, and its
arguments, if any.@refill

@noindent
For example:
@example
@group
@@defmethod @code{bar-class} bar-method argument
@dots{}
@@end defmethod
@end group
@end example

@noindent
illustrates the definition for a method called @code{bar-method} of
the class @code{bar-class}.  The method takes an argument.

@code{@@defmethod} creates an entry in the index of functions.

@item @@deftypemethod @var{class} @var{data-type} @var{name} @var{arguments}@dots{}
@findex defmethod
The @code{@@deftypemethod} command is the definition command for methods
in object-oriented typed languages, such as C++ and Java.  It is similar
to the @code{@@defmethod} command with the addition of the
@var{data-type} parameter to specify the return type of the method.
@code{@@deftypemethod} creates an entry in the index of functions.

@cindex Sample function definition

A function definition uses the @code{@@defun} and @code{@@end defun}
commands.  The name of the function follows immediately after the
@code{@@defun} command and it is followed, on the same line, by the
parameter list.@refill

Here is a definition from @ref{Calling Functions,,, elisp, The GNU Emacs
Lisp Reference Manual}.

@quotation
@defun apply function &rest arguments
@code{apply} calls @var{function} with @var{arguments}, just
like @code{funcall} but with one difference: the last of
@var{arguments} is a list of arguments to give to
@var{function}, rather than a single argument.  We also say
that this list is @dfn{appended} to the other arguments.

@code{apply} returns the result of calling @var{function}.
As with @code{funcall}, @var{function} must either be a Lisp
function or a primitive function; special forms and macros
do not make sense in @code{apply}.

@example
(setq f 'list)
    @result{} list
(apply f 'x 'y 'z)
@error{} Wrong type argument: listp, z
(apply '+ 1 2 '(3 4))
    @result{} 10
(apply '+ '(1 2 3 4))
    @result{} 10

(apply 'append '((a b c) nil (x y z) nil))
    @result{} (a b c x y z)
@end example

An interesting example of using @code{apply} is found in the description
of @code{mapcar}.@refill

@node Conditionals
@chapter Conditionally Visible Text
@cindex Conditionally visible text
@cindex Text, conditionally visible
@cindex Visibility of conditional text
@cindex If text conditionally visible

The @dfn{conditional commands} allow you to use different text for
different output formats, or for general conditions that you define.
For example, you can use them to specify different text for the
printed manual and the Info output.

The conditional commands comprise the following categories.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Commands specific to an output format (Info, @TeX{}, HTML, @dots{}).

@item
Commands specific to any output format @emph{other} than a given
one (not Info, not @TeX{}, @dots{}).

@item
`Raw' formatter text for any output format, passed straight
through with no interpretation of @@-commands.

@item
Format-independent variable substitutions, and testing if a variable
is set or clear.

@end itemize

@menu
* Conditional Commands::        Text for a given format.
* Conditional Not Commands::    Text for any format other than a given one.
* Raw Formatter Commands::      Using raw formatter commands.
* set clear value::             Variable tests and substitutions.
* Conditional Nesting::         Using conditionals inside conditionals.
@end menu


@node Conditional Commands
@section Conditional Commands

Texinfo has an @code{@@if@var{format}} environment for each output
format, to allow conditional inclusion of text for a particular output
format.

@findex ifinfo
@code{@@ifinfo} begins segments of text that should be ignored by
@TeX{} when it typesets the printed manual, and by @command{makeinfo}
when not producing Info output.  The segment of text appears only in
the Info file and, for historical compatibility, the plain text
output.

@findex ifdocbook
@findex ifhtml
@findex ifplaintext
@findex iftex
@findex ifxml
The environments for the other formats are analogous:

@table @code
@item @@ifdocbook @dots{} @@end ifdocbook
Text to appear only in the Docbook output.

@item @@ifhtml @dots{} @@end ifhtml
Text to appear only in the HTML output.

@item @@ifplaintext @dots{} @@end ifplaintext
Text to appear only in the plain text output.

@item @@iftex @dots{} @@end iftex
Text to appear only in the printed manual.

@item @@ifxml @dots{} @@end ifxml
Text to appear only in the XML output.
@end table

The @code{@@if@dots{}} and @code{@@end if@dots{}} commands must appear
on lines by themselves in your source file.

Here is an example showing all these conditionals:

@example
@@iftex
This text will appear only in the printed manual.
@@end iftex
@@ifinfo
However, this text will appear only in Info and plain text.
@@end ifinfo
@@ifhtml
And this text will only appear in HTML.
@@end ifhtml
@@ifplaintext
Whereas this text will only appear in plain text.
@@end ifplaintext
@@ifxml
Notwithstanding that this will only appear in XML.
@@end ifxml
@@ifdocbook
Nevertheless, this will only appear in Docbook.
@@end ifdocbook
@end example

@noindent
The preceding example produces the following line:

@iftex
This text will appear only in the printed manual.
@end iftex
@ifinfo
However, this text will appear only in Info and plain text.
@end ifinfo
@ifhtml
And this text will only appear in HTML.
@end ifhtml
@ifplaintext
Whereas this text will only appear in plain text.
@end ifplaintext
@ifxml
Notwithstanding that this will only appear in XML.
@end ifxml
@ifdocbook
Nevertheless, this will only appear in Docbook.
@end ifdocbook

@noindent
Notice that you only see one of the input lines, depending on which
version of the manual you are reading.


@node Conditional Not Commands
@section Conditional Not Commands
@findex ifnotdocbook
@findex ifnothtml
@findex ifnotinfo
@findex ifnotplaintext
@findex ifnottex
@findex ifnotxml

You can specify text to be included in any output format @emph{other}
than a given one with the @code{@@ifnot@dots{}} environments:

@example
@@ifnotdocbook @dots{} @@end ifnotdocbook
@@ifnothtml @dots{} @@end ifnothtml
@@ifnotinfo @dots{} @@end ifnotinfo
@@ifnotplaintext @dots{} @@end ifnotplaintext
@@ifnottex @dots{} @@end ifnottex
@@ifnotxml @dots{} @@end ifnotxml
@end example

@noindent
The @code{@@ifnot@dots{}} command and the @code{@@end} command must
appear on lines by themselves in your actual source file.

If the output file is being made in the given format, the
region is @emph{ignored}.  Otherwise, it is included.

There is one exception (for historical compatibility):
@code{@@ifnotinfo} text is omitted for both Info and plain text
output, not just Info.  To specify text which appears only in Info and
not in plain text, use @code{@@ifnotplaintext}, like this:

@example
@@ifinfo
@@ifnotplaintext
This will be in Info, but not plain text.
@@end ifnotplaintext
@@end ifinfo
@end example

The regions delimited by these commands are ordinary Texinfo source as
with @code{@@iftex}, not raw formatter source as with @code{@@tex}
(@pxref{Raw Formatter Commands}).


@node Raw Formatter Commands
@section Raw Formatter Commands
@cindex Raw formatter commands
@cindex @TeX{} commands, using ordinary
@cindex Ordinary @TeX{} commands, using
@cindex Commands using raw @TeX{}
@cindex Docbook, including raw
@cindex HTML, including raw
@cindex XML, including raw
@cindex Plain @TeX{}

Inside a region delineated by @code{@@iftex} and @code{@@end iftex},
you can embed some raw @TeX{} commands.  The Texinfo processors will
ignore such a region unless @TeX{} output is being produced.  You can
write the @TeX{} commands as you would write them in a normal @TeX{}
file, except that you must replace the @samp{\} used by @TeX{} with an
@samp{@@}.  For example, in the @code{@@titlepage} section of a
Texinfo file, you can use the @TeX{} command @code{@@vskip} to format
the copyright page.  (The @code{@@titlepage} command causes Info to
ignore the region automatically, as it does with the @code{@@iftex}
command.)

However, most features of plain @TeX{} will not work within
@code{@@iftex}, as they are overridden by Texinfo features.  The
purpose of @code{@@iftex} is to provide conditional processing for the
Texinfo source, not provide access to underlying formatting features.

@findex tex
You can enter plain @TeX{} completely, and use @samp{\} in the @TeX{}
commands, by delineating a region with the @code{@@tex} and @code{@@end
tex} commands.  All plain @TeX{} commands and category codes are
restored within an @code{@@tex} region.  The sole exception is that the
@code{@@} character still introduces a command, so that @code{@@end tex}
can be recognized properly.  As with @code{@@iftex}, Texinfo
processors will ignore such a region unless @TeX{} output is being produced.

@findex \gdef @r{within @code{@@tex}}
In complex cases, you may wish to define new @TeX{} macros within
@code{@@tex}.  You must use @code{\gdef} to do this, not @code{\def},
because @code{@@tex} regions are processed in a @TeX{} group.

@cindex Mathematical expressions
As an example, here is a mathematical expression written in plain @TeX{}:

@example
@@tex
$$ \chi^2 = \sum_@{i=1@}^N
         \left (y_i - (a + b x_i)
         \over \sigma_i\right)^2 $$
@@end tex
@end example

@noindent
The output of this example will appear only in a printed manual.  If
you are reading this in Info, you will not see the equation that appears
in the printed manual.
@iftex
In a printed manual, the above expression looks like
this:
@end iftex

@tex
$$ \chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N
         \left(y_i - (a + b x_i)
         \over \sigma_i\right)^2 $$
@end tex

@findex ifhtml
@findex html
Analogously, you can use @code{@@ifhtml @dots{} @@end ifhtml} to delimit
a region to be included in HTML output only, and @code{@@html @dots{}
@@end html} for a region of raw HTML.

@findex ifxml
@findex xml
Likewise, you can use @code{@@ifxml @dots{} @@end ifxml} to delimit
a region to be included in XML output only, and @code{@@xml @dots{}
@@end xml} for a region of raw XML.

@findex ifdocbook
@findex docbook
Again likewise, you can use @code{@@ifdocbook @dots{} @@end ifdocbook}
to delimit a region to be included in Docbook output only, and
@code{@@docbook @dots{} @@end docbook} for a region of raw Docbook.

In all cases, the exception to the raw processing is that @code{@@} is
still an escape character, so the @code{@@end} command can be
recognized.


@node set clear value
@section @code{@@set}, @code{@@clear}, and @code{@@value}

You can direct the Texinfo formatting commands to format or ignore parts
of a Texinfo file with the @code{@@set}, @code{@@clear}, @code{@@ifset},
and @code{@@ifclear} commands.

Here are brief descriptions of these commands, see the following
sections for more details:

@table @code
@item @@set @var{flag} [@var{value}]
Set the variable @var{flag}, to the optional @var{value} if specified.

@item @@clear @var{flag}
Undefine the variable @var{flag}, whether or not it was previously defined.

@item @@ifset @var{flag}
If @var{flag} is set, text through the next @code{@@end ifset} command
is formatted.  If @var{flag} is clear, text through the following
@code{@@end ifset} command is ignored.

@item @@ifclear @var{flag}
If @var{flag} is set, text through the next @code{@@end ifclear} command
is ignored.  If @var{flag} is clear, text through the following
@code{@@end ifclear} command is formatted.
@end table

@menu
* set value::                   Expand a flag variable to a string.
* ifset ifclear::               Format a region if a flag is set.
* value Example::               An easy way to update edition information.
@end menu


@node set value
@subsection @code{@@set} and @code{@@value}
@findex set
@findex value
@findex clear

You use the @code{@@set} command to specify a value for a flag, which
is later expanded by the @code{@@value} command.

A @dfn{flag} (aka @dfn{variable}) is an identifier.  It is best to use
only letters and numerals in a flag name, not @samp{-} or
@samp{_}---they will work in some contexts, but not all, due to
limitations in @TeX{}.

The value is the remainder of the input line, and can contain anything.

Write the @code{@@set} command like this:

@example
@@set foo This is a string.
@end example

@noindent
This sets the value of the flag @code{foo} to ``This is a string.''.

The Texinfo formatters then replace an @code{@@value@{@var{flag}@}}
command with the string to which @var{flag} is set.  Thus, when
@code{foo} is set as shown above, the Texinfo formatters convert this:

@example
@group
@@value@{foo@}
@exdent @r{to this:}
This is a string.
@end group
@end example

You can write an @code{@@value} command within a paragraph; but you
must write an @code{@@set} command on a line of its own.

If you write the @code{@@set} command like this:

@example
@@set foo
@end example

@noindent
without specifying a string, the value of @code{foo} is the empty string.

If you clear a previously set flag with @code{@@clear @var{flag}}, a
subsequent @code{@@value@{flag@}} command will report an error.

For example, if you set @code{foo} as follows:

@example
@@set howmuch very, very, very
@end example

@noindent
then the formatters transform

@example
@group
It is a @@value@{howmuch@} wet day.
@exdent @r{into}
It is a very, very, very wet day.
@end group
@end example

If you write

@example
@@clear howmuch
@end example

@noindent
then the formatters transform

@example
@group
It is a @@value@{howmuch@} wet day.
@exdent @r{into}
It is a @{No value for "howmuch"@} wet day.
@end group
@end example


@node ifset ifclear
@subsection @code{@@ifset} and @code{@@ifclear}

@findex ifset
When a @var{flag} is set, the Texinfo formatting commands format text
between subsequent pairs of @code{@@ifset @var{flag}} and @code{@@end
ifset} commands.  When the @var{flag} is cleared, the Texinfo formatting
commands do @emph{not} format the text.  @code{@@ifclear} operates
analogously.

Write the conditionally formatted text between @code{@@ifset @var{flag}}
and @code{@@end ifset} commands, like this:

@example
@group
@@ifset @var{flag}
@var{conditional-text}
@@end ifset
@end group
@end example

For example, you can create one document that has two variants, such as
a manual for a `large' and `small' model:

@cindex Shrubbery
@example
You can use this machine to dig up shrubs
without hurting them.

@@set large

@@ifset large
It can also dig up fully grown trees.
@@end ifset

Remember to replant promptly @dots{}
@end example

@noindent
In the example, the formatting commands will format the text between
@code{@@ifset large} and @code{@@end ifset} because the @code{large}
flag is set.

When @var{flag} is cleared, the Texinfo formatting commands do
@emph{not} format the text between @code{@@ifset @var{flag}} and
@code{@@end ifset}; that text is ignored and does not appear in either
printed or Info output.

For example, if you clear the flag of the preceding example by writing
an @code{@@clear large} command after the @code{@@set large} command
(but before the conditional text), then the Texinfo formatting commands
ignore the text between the @code{@@ifset large} and @code{@@end ifset}
commands.  In the formatted output, that text does not appear; in both
printed and Info output, you see only the lines that say, ``You can use
this machine to dig up shrubs without hurting them.  Remember to replant
promptly @dots{}''.

@findex ifclear
If a flag is cleared with an @code{@@clear @var{flag}} command, then
the formatting commands format text between subsequent pairs of
@code{@@ifclear} and @code{@@end ifclear} commands.  But if the flag
is set with @code{@@set @var{flag}}, then the formatting commands do
@emph{not} format text between an @code{@@ifclear} and an @code{@@end
ifclear} command; rather, they ignore that text.  An @code{@@ifclear}
command looks like this:

@example
@@ifclear @var{flag}
@end example


@node value Example
@subsection @code{@@value} Example

You can use the @code{@@value} command to minimize the number of
places you need to change when you record an update to a manual.

@example
@group

After you format the manual, the @code{@@value} constructs have been
expanded, so the output contains text like this:

@example
@group

of `The GNU Make Manual', for `make', Version 3.63 Beta.
@end group
@end example
@end enumerate

When you update the manual, you change only the values of the flags; you
do not need to edit the three sections.


@node Conditional Nesting
@section Conditional Nesting
@cindex Conditionals, nested
@cindex Nesting conditionals

Conditionals can be nested; however, the details are a little tricky.
The difficulty comes with failing conditionals, such as
@code{@@ifhtml} when HTML is not being produced, where the included
text is to be ignored.  However, it is not to be @emph{completely}
ignored, since it is useful to have one @code{@@ifset} inside another,
for example---that is a way to include text only if two conditions are
met.  Here's an example:

@example
@@ifset somevar
@@ifset anothervar
Both somevar and anothervar are set.
@@end ifset
@@ifclear anothervar
Somevar is set, anothervar is not.
@@end ifclear
@@end ifset
@end example

Technically, Texinfo requires that for a failing conditional, the
ignored text must be properly nested with respect to that failing
conditional.  Unfortunately, it's not always feasible to check that
@emph{all} conditionals are properly nested, because then the
processors could have to fully interpret the ignored text, which
defeats the purpose of the command.  Here's an example illustrating
these rules:

@example
@@ifset a
@@ifset b
@@ifclear ok  - ok, ignored
@@end junky   - ok, ignored
@@end ifset
@@c WRONG - missing @@end ifset.
@end example

Finally, as mentioned above, all conditional commands must be on lines
by themselves, with no text (even spaces) before or after.  Otherwise,
the processors cannot reliably determine which commands to consider
for nesting purposes.

file, but after @code{@@setfilename}
(@pxref{setfilename,,@code{@@setfilename}}):

@example
@@documentlanguage @var{ll}[_@var{cc}]
@end example

Include a two-letter ISO@tie{}639-2 language code (@var{ll}) following
the command name, optionally followed by an underscore and two-letter
ISO@tie{}3166 two-letter country code (@var{cc}).  If you have a
multilingual document, the intent is to be able to use this command
multiple times, to declare each language change.  If the command is
not used at all, the default is @code{en_US} for US English.

As with GNU Gettext (@pxref{Top,,,gettext, Gettext}), if the country
code is omitted, the main dialect is assumed where possible.  For
example, @code{de} is equivalent to @code{de_DE} (German as spoken in
Germany).

@cindex Document strings, translation of
For Info and other online output, this command changes the translation
of various @dfn{document strings} such as ``see'' in cross-references
(@pxref{Cross References}), ``Function' in defuns (@pxref{Definition
Commands}), and so on.  Some strings, such as ``Node:'', ``Next:'',
``Menu:'', etc., are keywords in Info output, so are not translated
there; they are translated in other output formats.

@cindex @file{txi-@var{cc}.tex}
For @TeX{}, this command causes a file @file{txi-@var{locale}.tex} to
be read (if it exists).  If @code{@@documentlanguage} argument
contains the optional @samp{_@var{cc}} suffix, this is tried first.
For example, with @code{@@documentlanguage de_DE}, @TeX{} first looks
for @file{txi-de_DE.tex}, then @file{txi-de.tex}.

Such a @file{txi-*} file is intended to redefine the various English
words used in @TeX{} output, such as `Chapter', `See', and so on.  We
are aware that individual words like these cannot always be translated
in isolation, and that a very different strategy would be required for
ideographic (among other) scripts.  Help in improving Texinfo's
language support is welcome.

@cindex Hyphenation patterns, language-dependent
@code{@@documentlanguage} also changes @TeX{}'s current hyphenation
patterns, if the @TeX{} program being run has the necessary support
included.  This will generally not be the case for @command{tex}
itself, but will often be the case for recent distributions of
extended @TeX{} programs @command{etex} (DVI output) and
@command{pdftex} (PDF output), such as @TeX{} Live 2008.
@command{texi2dvi} will use the extended @TeX{}s if they are
available (@pxref{Format with texi2dvi}).

In September 2006, the W3C Internationalization Activity released a
new recommendation for specifying languages:
@url{http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt}.  When Gettext
supports this new scheme, Texinfo will too.

@cindex Encoding, declaring
@cindex Input encoding, declaring
@cindex Character set, declaring
@cindex Document input encoding

The @code{@@documentencoding} command declares the input document
encoding.  Write it on a line by itself, with a valid encoding
specification following, near the beginning of the file but after
@code{@@setfilename} (@pxref{setfilename,,@code{@@setfilename}}):

@example
@@documentencoding @var{enc}
@end example

At present, Texinfo supports only these encodings:

@table @code
@item US-ASCII
This has no particular effect, but it's included for completeness.

@itemx UTF-8
The vast global character encoding, expressed in 8-bit bytes.
The Texinfo processors have no deep knowledge of Unicode; for the most
part, they just pass along the input they are given to the output.

@itemx ISO-8859-1
@itemx ISO-8859-15
@item ISO-8859-2
These specify the standard encodings for Western European (the first
two) and Eastern European languages (the third), respectively.  ISO
8859-15 replaces some little-used characters from 8859-1 (e.g.,
precomposed fractions) with more commonly needed ones, such as the
Euro symbol (@euro{}).

A full description of the encodings is beyond our scope here;
one useful reference is @uref{http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso8859.html}.

@item koi8-r
This is the commonly used encoding for the Russian language.

@item koi8-u
This is the commonly used encoding for the Ukrainian language.

@end table

Specifying an encoding @var{enc} has the following effects:

@opindex --enable-encoding
@cindex Local Variables: section, for encoding
@cindex Info output, and encoding
In Info output, unless the option @option{--disable-encoding} is given
to @command{makeinfo}, a so-called `Local Variables' section
(@pxref{File Variables,,,emacs,The GNU Emacs Manual}) is output
including @var{enc}.  This allows Info readers to set the encoding
appropriately.

@example
Local Variables:
coding: @var{enc}
End:
@end example

Also, in Info and plain text output (barring
@option{--disable-encoding}), accent constructs and special
characters, such as @code{@@'e}, are output as the actual 8-bit
character in the given encoding.

@cindex HTML output, and encodings
@cindex @code{http-equiv}, and charset specification
@cindex @code{<meta>} HTML tag, and charset specification
In HTML output, a @samp{<meta>} tag is output, in the @samp{<head>}
section of the HTML, that specifies @var{enc}.  Web servers and
browsers cooperate to use this information so the correct encoding is
used to display the page, if supported by the system.

@example
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;
     charset=@var{enc}">
@end example

In split HTML output, if @option{--transliterate-file-names} is
given (@pxref{HTML Xref 8-bit Character Expansion}), the names of HTML
files are formed by transliteration of the corresponding node names,
using the specified encoding.

In XML and Docbook output, the given document encoding is written in
the output file as usual with those formats.

In @TeX{} output, the characters which are supported in the standard
Computer Modern fonts are output accordingly.  (For example, this
means using constructed accents rather than precomposed glyphs.)
Using a missing character generates a warning message, as does
specifying an unimplemented encoding.

Texinfo provides several ways to define new commands:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A Texinfo @dfn{macro} allows you to define a new Texinfo command as any
sequence of text and/or existing commands (including other macros).  The
macro can have any number of @dfn{parameters}---text you supply each
time you use the macro.

Incidentally, these macros have nothing to do with the @code{@@defmac}
command, which is for documenting macros in the subject of the manual
(@pxref{Def Cmd Template}).

@item
@samp{@@alias} is a convenient way to define a new name for an existing
command.

@item
@samp{@@definfoenclose} allows you to define new commands with
customized output in the Info file.

@node Defining Macros
@section Defining Macros
@cindex Defining macros
@cindex Macro definitions

@findex macro
You use the Texinfo @code{@@macro} command to define a macro, like this:

@example
@@macro @var{macroname}@{@var{param1}, @var{param2}, @dots{}@}
@var{text} @dots{} \@var{param1}\ @dots{}
@@end macro
@end example

The @dfn{parameters} @var{param1}, @var{param2}, @dots{} correspond to
arguments supplied when the macro is subsequently used in the document
(described in the next section).

@cindex Macro names, valid characters in
@cindex Names of macros, valid characters of
For a macro to work consistently with @TeX{}, @var{macroname} must
consist entirely of letters: no digits, hyphens, underscores, or other
special characters.  So, we recommend using only letters.  However,
@command{makeinfo} will accept anything except @samp{@{@}_^=};
@samp{_} and @samp{^} are excluded so that macros can be called in
@code{@@math} mode without a following space
(@pxref{math,,@code{@@math}}).

If a macro needs no parameters, you can define it either with an empty
list (@samp{@@macro foo @{@}}) or with no braces at all (@samp{@@macro
foo}).

@cindex Body of a macro
@cindex Mutually recursive macros
@cindex Recursion, mutual
The definition or @dfn{body} of the macro can contain most Texinfo
commands, including previously-defined macros.  Not-yet-defined macro
invocations are not allowed; thus, it is not possible to have mutually
recursive Texinfo macros.  Also, a macro definition that defines another
macro does not work in @TeX{} due to limitations in the design of
@code{@@macro}.

@cindex Parameters to macros
In the macro body, instances of a parameter name surrounded by
backslashes, as in @samp{\@var{param1}\} in the example above, are
replaced by the corresponding argument from the macro invocation.  You
can use parameter names any number of times in the body, including zero.

@cindex Backslash in macros
To get a single @samp{\} in the macro expansion, use @samp{\\}.  Any
other use of @samp{\} in the body yields a warning.

@cindex Spaces in macros
@cindex Whitespace in macros
The newlines after the @code{@@macro} line and before the @code{@@end
macro} line are ignored, that is, not included in the macro body.  All
other whitespace is treated according to the usual Texinfo rules.

@cindex Recursive macro invocations
@findex rmacro
To allow a macro to be used recursively, that is, in an argument to a
call to itself, you must define it with @samp{@@rmacro}, like this:

@example
@@rmacro rmac @{arg@}
a\arg\b
@@end rmacro
@dots{}
@@rmac@{1@@rmac@{text@}2@}
@end example

This produces the output `a1atextb2b'.  With @samp{@@macro} instead of
@samp{@@rmacro}, an error message is given.

@findex unmacro
@cindex Macros, undefining
@cindex Undefining macros
You can undefine a macro @var{foo} with @code{@@unmacro @var{foo}}.
It is not an error to undefine a macro that is already undefined.
For example:

@example
@@unmacro foo
@end example


@node Invoking Macros
@section Invoking Macros
@cindex Invoking macros
@cindex Expanding macros
@cindex Running macros
@cindex Macro invocation

After a macro is defined (see the previous section), you can use
(@dfn{invoke}) it in your document like this:

@example
@@@var{macroname} @{@var{arg1}, @var{arg2}, @dots{}@}
@end example

@noindent and the result will be just as if you typed the body of
@var{macroname} at that spot.  For example:

@example
@@macro foo @{p, q@}
Together: \p\ & \q\.
@@end macro
@@foo@{a, b@}
@end example

@noindent produces:

@display
Together: a & b.
@end display

@cindex Backslash, and macros
Thus, the arguments and parameters are separated by commas and delimited
by braces; any whitespace after (but not before) a comma is ignored.
The braces are required in the invocation (but not the definition), even
when the macro takes no arguments, consistent with all other Texinfo
commands.  For example:

@example
@@macro argless @{@}
No arguments here.
@@end macro
@@argless@{@}
@end example

@noindent produces:

@display
No arguments here.
@end display

@cindex Comma, in macro arguments
Passing strings containing commas as macro arguments requires special
care, since they should be properly @dfn{quoted} to prevent
@command{makeinfo} from confusing them with argument separators.  To
manually quote a comma, the most reliable method is to use the
@code{@@comma@{@}} command.  For @code{makeinfo}, you can also prepend
a backslash character, as in @samp{\,}, but this does not work with
@TeX{}.

It's not always necessary to quote commas.  To facilitate use of
macros, @command{makeinfo} implements a set of rules called
@dfn{automatic quoting}:

@enumerate 1
@item If a macro takes only one argument, all commas in its invocation
are quoted by default.  For example:

@example
@group
@@macro FIXME@{text@}
@@strong@{FIXME: \text\@}
@@end macro

@@FIXME@{A nice feature, though it can be dangerous.@}
@end group
@end example

@noindent
will produce the following output

@example
@strong{FIXME: A nice feature, though it can be dangerous.}
@end example

And indeed, it can.  Namely, @command{makeinfo} does not control the
number of arguments passed to one-argument macros, so be careful when
you invoke them.

@item If a macro invocation includes another command (including a
recursive invocation of itself), any commas in the nested command
invocation(s) are quoted by default.  For example, in

@example
@@say@{@@strong@{Yes, I do@}, person one@}
@end example

the comma after @samp{Yes} is implicitly quoted.  Here's another
example, with a recursive macro:

@example
@group
@@rmacro cat@{a,b@}
\a\\b\
@@end rmacro

@@cat@{@@cat@{foo, bar@}, baz@}
@end group
@end example

@noindent
will produce the string @samp{foobarbaz}.

@item Otherwise, a comma should be explicitly quoted, as above, to be
treated as a part of an argument.
@end enumerate

@cindex Braces, in macro arguments
@cindex Backslash, in macro arguments
In addition to the comma, characters that need to be quoted in macro
arguments are curly braces and backslash.  For example:

@example
@@@var{macname} @{\\\@{\@}\,@}
@end example

@noindent
will pass the (almost certainly error-producing) argument
@samp{\@{@},} to @var{macname}.

Unfortunately, this has not been reliably implemented in @TeX{}.  When
macros are used in the argument to other commands, for example, errors
or incorrect output (the @samp{\} ``escape'' being included
literally) are likely to result.

If the macro is defined to take a single argument, and is invoked
without any braces, the entire rest of the line after the macro name is
supplied as the argument.  For example:

@example
@@macro bar @{p@}
Twice: \p\ & \p\.
@@end macro
@@bar aah
@end example

@noindent produces:

@c Sorry for cheating, but let's not require macros to process the manual.
@display
Twice: aah & aah.
@end display

If the macro is defined to take a single argument, and is invoked with
braces, the braced text is passed as the argument, regardless of
commas.  For example:

@example
@@macro bar @{p@}
Twice: \p\ & \p\.
@@end macro
@@bar@{a,b@}
@end example

@noindent produces:

@display
Twice: a,b & a,b.
@end display


@node Macro Details
@section Macro Details and Caveats
@cindex Macro details
@cindex Details of macro usage
@cindex Caveats for macro usage

Due to unavoidable limitations, certain macro-related constructs cause
problems with @TeX{}.  If you get macro-related errors when producing
the printed version of a manual, try expanding the macros with
@command{makeinfo} by invoking @command{texi2dvi} with the @samp{-E}
option (@pxref{Format with texi2dvi}).

@itemize @bullet
@item
As mentioned earlier, macro names must consist entirely of letters.

@item
It is not advisable to redefine any @TeX{} primitive, plain, or
Texinfo command name as a macro. Unfortunately this is a very large
set of names, and the possible resulting errors are unpredictable.

@item
All macros are expanded inside at least one @TeX{} group.  This means
that @code{@@set} and other such commands have no effect inside a
macro.

@item
Commas in macro arguments, even if escaped by a backslash, don't
always work.

@item
Macro arguments cannot cross lines.

@item
It is (usually) best to avoid comments inside macro definitions, but
see the next item.

@item
Macros containing a command which must be on a line by itself, such as
a conditional, cannot be invoked in the middle of a line.  In general,
the interaction of newlines in the macro definitions and invocations
depends on the precise commands and context.  You may be able to work
around some problems with judicious use of @code{@@c}.  Suppose you
define a macro that is always intended to be used on a line by itself:

@example
@@macro linemac
@@cindex whatever
@@c
@@end macro
...
foo
@@linemac
bar
@end example

Without the @code{@@c}, there will be an unwanted blank line between
the @samp{@@cindex whatever} and the @samp{bar} (one newline comes
from the macro definition, one from after the invocation), causing a
paragraph break.

On the other hand, you wouldn't want the @code{@@c} if the macro was
sometimes invoked in the middle of a line (the text after the
invocation would be treated as a comment).

@item
In general, you can't arbitrarily substitute a macro call for Texinfo
command arguments, even when the text is the same.  It might work with
some commands, it fails with others.  Best not to do it at all.  For
instance, this fails:

@example
@@macro offmacro
off
@@end macro
@@headings @@offmacro
@end example

@noindent
You would expect this to be equivalent to @code{@@headings off}, but
for @TeX{}nical reasons, it fails with a mysterious error message
(@code{Paragraph ended before @@headings was complete}).

@item
Macros cannot define macros in the natural way.  To do this, you must
use conditionals and raw @TeX{}.  For example:

@example
@@ifnottex
@@macro ctor @{name, arg@}
@@macro \name\
something involving \arg\ somehow
@@end macro
@@end macro
@@end ifnottex
@@tex
\gdef\ctor#1@{\ctorx#1,@}
\gdef\ctorx#1,#2,@{\def#1@{something involving #2 somehow@}@}
@@end tex
@end example

@end itemize

The @command{makeinfo} implementation also has limitations:

@itemize
@item
@code{@@verbatim} and macros do not mix; for instance, you can't start
a verbatim block inside a macro and end it outside.
(@xref{verbatim}.)  Starting any environment inside a macro and ending
it outside may or may not work, for that matter.

@item
Macros that completely define macros are ok, but it's not possible to
have incorrectly nested macro definitions.  That is, @code{@@macro}
and @code{@@end macro} (likewise for @code{@@rmacro}) must be
correctly paired.  For example, you cannot start a macro definition
within a macro, and then end the nested definition outside the macro.

@item
@code{@@rmacro} is a kludge.

@end itemize

One more limitation is common to both implementations: white space is
ignored at the beginnings of lines.

Future major revisions of Texinfo may ease some of these limitations
(by introducing a new macro syntax).


@node alias
@section @samp{@@alias @var{new}=@var{existing}}
@cindex Aliases, command
@cindex Command aliases
@findex alias

The @samp{@@alias} command defines a new command to be just like an
existing one.  This is useful for defining additional markup names, thus
preserving semantic information in the input even though the output
result may be the same.

Write the @samp{@@alias} command on a line by itself, followed by the
new command name, an equals sign, and the existing command name.
Whitespace around the equals sign is ignored.  Thus:
@example
@@alias @var{new} = @var{existing}
@end example

For example, if your document contains citations for both books and
some other media (movies, for example), you might like to define a
macro @code{@@moviecite@{@}} that does the same thing as an ordinary
@code{@@cite@{@}} but conveys the extra semantic information as well.
You'd do this as follows:

@example
@@alias moviecite = cite
@end example

Macros do not always have the same effect as aliases, due to vagaries
of argument parsing.  Also, aliases are much simpler to define than
macros.  So the command is not redundant.  (It was also heavily used
in the Jargon File!)

Aliases must not be recursive, directly or indirectly.

It is not advisable to redefine any @TeX{} primitive, plain, or
Texinfo command name as an alias.  Unfortunately this is a very large
set of names, and the possible resulting errors are completely random.


@node definfoenclose
@section @samp{definfoenclose}: Customized Highlighting
@cindex Highlighting, customized
@cindex Customized highlighting
@findex definfoenclose

A @code{@@definfoenclose} command may be used to define a highlighting
command for Info, but not for @TeX{}.  A command defined using
@code{@@definfoenclose} marks text by enclosing it in strings that
precede and follow the text.  You can use this to get closer control of
your Info output.

Presumably, if you define a command with @code{@@definfoenclose} for Info,
you will create a corresponding command for @TeX{}, either in
@file{texinfo.tex}, @file{texinfo.cnf}, or within an @samp{@@iftex} in
your document.

Write a @code{@@definfoenclose} command on a line and follow it with
three arguments separated by commas.  The first argument to
@code{@@definfoenclose} is the @@-command name (without the @code{@@});
the second argument is the Info start delimiter string; and the third
argument is the Info end delimiter string.  The latter two arguments
enclose the highlighted text in the Info file.  A delimiter string may
contain spaces.  Neither the start nor end delimiter is required.  If
you do not want a start delimiter but do want an end delimiter, you must
follow the command name with two commas in a row; otherwise, the Info
formatting commands will naturally misinterpret the end delimiter string
you intended as the start delimiter string.

If you do a @code{@@definfoenclose} on the name of a predefined macro
(such as @code{@@emph}, @code{@@strong}, @code{@@t}, or @code{@@i}), the
enclosure definition will override the built-in definition.

An enclosure command defined this way takes one argument in braces; this
is intended for new markup commands (@pxref{Marking Text}).

@findex phoo
For example, you can write:

@example
@@definfoenclose phoo,//,\\
@end example

@noindent
near the beginning of a Texinfo file to define @code{@@phoo} as an Info
formatting command that inserts `//' before and `\\' after the argument
to @code{@@phoo}.  You can then write @code{@@phoo@{bar@}} wherever you
want `//bar\\' highlighted in Info.

Also, for @TeX{} formatting, you could write

@example
@@iftex
@@global@@let@@phoo=@@i
@@end iftex
@end example

@noindent
to define @code{@@phoo} as a command that causes @TeX{} to typeset the
argument to @code{@@phoo} in italics.

Each definition applies to its own formatter: one for @TeX{}, the other
for @code{texinfo-format-buffer} or @code{texinfo-format-region}.  The
@code{@@definfoenclose} command need not be within @samp{@@ifinfo}, but
the raw @TeX{} commands do need to be in @samp{@@iftex}.

@findex headword
Here is another example: write

@example
@@definfoenclose headword, , :
@end example

@noindent
near the beginning of the file, to define @code{@@headword} as an Info
formatting command that inserts nothing before and a colon after the
argument to @code{@@headword}.

@samp{@@definfoenclose} definitions must not be recursive, directly or
indirectly.


@node Include Files
@chapter Include Files
@cindex Include files

When @TeX{} or an Info formatting command sees an @code{@@include}
command in a Texinfo file, it processes the contents of the file named
by the command and incorporates them into the DVI or Info file being
created.  Index entries from the included file are incorporated into
the indices of the output file.

Include files let you keep a single large document as a collection of
conveniently small parts.

@end menu

@node Using Include Files
@section How to Use Include Files
@findex include

To include another file within a Texinfo file, write the
@code{@@include} command at the beginning of a line and follow it on
the same line by the name of a file to be included.  For example:

@example
@@include buffers.texi
@end example

The name of the file is taken literally, with a single exception:
@code{@@value@{@var{var}@}} references are expanded.  This makes it
possible to reliably include files in other directories in a
distribution.  @xref{verbatiminclude,,@code{@@verbatiminclude}}, for
an example.

An included file should simply be a segment of text that you expect to
be included as is into the overall or @dfn{outer} Texinfo file; it
should not contain the standard beginning and end parts of a Texinfo
file.  In particular, you should not start an included file with a
line saying @samp{\input texinfo}; if you do, that phrase is inserted
into the output file as is.  Likewise, you should not end an included
file with an @code{@@bye} command; nothing after @code{@@bye} is
formatted.

In the past, you were required to write an @code{@@setfilename} line at the
beginning of an included file, but no longer.  Now, it does not matter
whether you write such a line.  If an @code{@@setfilename} line exists
in an included file, it is ignored.

Conventionally, an included file begins with an @code{@@node} line that
is followed by an @code{@@chapter} line.  Each included file is one
chapter.  This makes it easy to use the regular node and menu creating
and updating commands to create the node pointers and menus within the
included file.  However, the simple Emacs node and menu creating and
updating commands do not work with multiple Texinfo files.  Thus you
cannot use these commands to fill in the `Next', `Previous', and `Up'
pointers of the @code{@@node} line that begins the included file.  Also,
you cannot use the regular commands to create a master menu for the
whole file.  Either you must insert the menus and the `Next',
`Previous', and `Up' pointers by hand, or you must use the GNU Emacs
Texinfo mode command, @code{texinfo-multiple-files-update}, that is
designed for @code{@@include} files.

When an included file does not have any node lines in it, the
multiple files update command does not try to create a menu entry
for it.  Consequently, you can include any file, such as a
version or an update file without node lines, not just files that
are chapters.  Small includable files like this are created by
Automake (@pxref{GNU Sample Texts}).


@node texinfo-multiple-files-update
@section @code{texinfo-multiple-files-update}
@findex texinfo-multiple-files-update

GNU Emacs Texinfo mode provides the @code{texinfo-multiple-files-update}
command.  This command creates or updates `Next', `Previous', and `Up'
pointers of included files as well as those in the outer or overall
Texinfo file, and it creates or updates a main menu in the outer file.
Depending whether you call it with optional arguments, the command
updates only the pointers in the first @code{@@node} line of the
included files or all of them:

@table @kbd
@item M-x texinfo-multiple-files-update
Called without any arguments:

@itemize @minus
@item
Create or update the `Next', `Previous', and `Up' pointers of the
first @code{@@node} line in each file included in an outer or overall
Texinfo file.

@item
Create or update the `Top' level node pointers of the outer or
overall file.

@item
Create or update a main menu in the outer file.
@end itemize

@item C-u M-x texinfo-multiple-files-update
Called with @kbd{C-u} as a prefix argument:

@itemize @minus{}
@item
Create or update pointers in the first @code{@@node} line in each
included file.

@item
Create or update the `Top' level node pointers of the outer file.

@item
Create and insert a master menu in the outer file.  The master menu
is made from all the menus in all the included files.
@end itemize

@item C-u 8 M-x texinfo-multiple-files-update
Called with a numeric prefix argument, such as @kbd{C-u 8}:

@itemize @minus
@item
Create or update @strong{all} the `Next', `Previous', and `Up' pointers
of all the included files.

@item
Create or update @strong{all} the menus of all the included
files.

@item
Create or update the `Top' level node pointers of the outer or
overall file.

@item
And then create a master menu in the outer file.  This is similar to
invoking @code{texinfo-master-menu} with an argument when you are
working with just one file.
@end itemize
@end table

Note the use of the prefix argument in interactive use: with a regular
prefix argument, just @w{@kbd{C-u}}, the
@code{texinfo-multiple-files-update} command inserts a master menu;
with a numeric prefix argument, such as @kbd{C-u 8}, the command
updates @strong{every} pointer and menu in @strong{all} the files and then inserts a
master menu.


@node Include Files Requirements
@section Include Files Requirements
@cindex Include files requirements
@cindex Requirements for include files

If you plan to use the @code{texinfo-multiple-files-update} command,
the outer Texinfo file that lists included files within it should
contain nothing but the beginning and end parts of a Texinfo file, and
a number of @code{@@include} commands listing the included files.  It
should not even include indices, which should be listed in an included
file of their own.

Moreover, each of the included files must contain exactly one highest
level node (conventionally, @code{@@chapter} or equivalent),
and this node must be the first node in the included file.
Furthermore, each of these highest level nodes in each included file
must be at the same hierarchical level in the file structure.
Usually, each is an @code{@@chapter}, an @code{@@appendix}, or an
@code{@@unnumbered} node.  Thus, normally, each included file contains
one, and only one, chapter or equivalent-level node.

The outer file should contain only @emph{one} node, the `Top' node.  It
should @emph{not} contain any nodes besides the single `Top' node.  The
@code{texinfo-multiple-files-update} command will not process
them.

@node Include Files Evolution
@section Evolution of Include Files

When Info was first created, it was customary to create many small
Info files on one subject.  Each Info file was formatted from its own
Texinfo source file.  This custom meant that Emacs did not need to
make a large buffer to hold the whole of a large Info file when
someone wanted information; instead, Emacs allocated just enough
memory for the small Info file that contained the particular
information sought.  This way, Emacs could avoid wasting memory.

References from one file to another were made by referring to the file
name as well as the node name. (@xref{Other Info Files, , Referring to
Other Info Files}.  Also, see @ref{Four and Five Arguments, ,
@code{@@xref} with Four and Five Arguments}.)

Include files were designed primarily as a way to create a single,
large printed manual out of several smaller Info files.  In a printed
manual, all the references were within the same document, so @TeX{}
could automatically determine the references' page numbers.  The Info
formatting commands used include files only for creating joint
indices; each of the individual Texinfo files had to be formatted for
Info individually.  (Each, therefore, required its own
@code{@@setfilename} line.)

However, because large Info files are now split automatically, it is
no longer necessary to keep them small.

Nowadays, multiple Texinfo files are used mostly for large documents,
such as @cite{The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual}, and for projects
in which several different people write different sections of a
document simultaneously.

In addition, the Info formatting commands have been extended to work
with the @code{@@include} command so as to create a single large Info
file that is split into smaller files if necessary.  This means that
you can write menus and cross references without naming the different
Texinfo files.

There are three major shell commands for making a printed manual from a
Texinfo file: one for converting the Texinfo file into a file that will be
printed, a second for sorting indices, and a third for printing the
formatted document.  When you use the shell commands, you can either
work directly in the operating system shell or work within a shell
inside GNU Emacs.

If you are using GNU Emacs, you can use commands provided by Texinfo
mode instead of shell commands.  In addition to the three commands to
format a file, sort the indices, and print the result, Texinfo mode
offers key bindings for commands to recenter the output buffer, show the
print queue, and delete a job from the print queue.

@node Use TeX
@section Use @TeX{}

The typesetting program called @TeX{} is used for formatting a Texinfo
file.  @TeX{} is a very powerful typesetting program and, if used correctly,
does an exceptionally good job.  (@xref{Obtaining TeX, , How to Obtain
@TeX{}}, for information on how to obtain @TeX{}.)

The standalone @code{makeinfo} program and Emacs functions
@code{texinfo-format-region} and @code{texinfo-format-buffer} commands
read the very same @@-commands in the Texinfo file as does @TeX{}, but
process them differently to make an Info file (@pxref{Creating an Info
File}).


@node Format with tex/texindex
@section Format with @code{tex} and @code{texindex}
@cindex Shell formatting with @code{tex} and @code{texindex}
@cindex Formatting with @code{tex} and @code{texindex}
@cindex DVI file

You can format the Texinfo file with the shell command @code{tex}
followed by the name of the Texinfo file.  For example:

@example
tex foo.texi
@end example

@noindent @TeX{} will produce a @dfn{DVI file} as well as several auxiliary
files containing information for indices, cross references, etc.  The
DVI file (for @dfn{DeVice Independent} file) can be printed on virtually
any device (see the following sections).

@pindex texindex
The @code{tex} formatting command itself does not sort the indices; it
writes an output file of unsorted index data.  To generate a printed
index after running the @command{tex} command, you first need a sorted
index to work from.  The @command{texindex} command sorts indices.
(The source file @file{texindex.c} comes as part of the standard
Texinfo distribution, among other places.)  (@command{texi2dvi} runs
@command{tex} and @command{texindex} as necessary.)

@cindex Names of index files
@cindex Index file names
The @code{tex} formatting command outputs unsorted index files under
names that obey a standard convention: the name of your main input file
with any @samp{.tex} (or similar, @pxref{tex invocation,,, web2c,
Web2c}) extension removed, followed by the two letter names of indices.
For example, the raw index output files for the input file
@file{foo.texinfo} would be @file{foo.cp}, @file{foo.vr}, @file{foo.fn},
@file{foo.tp}, @file{foo.pg} and @file{foo.ky}.  Those are exactly the
arguments to give to @code{texindex}.

@need 1000
@cindex Wildcards
@cindex Globbing
Instead of specifying all the unsorted index file names explicitly, you
can use @samp{??} as shell wildcards and give the command in this
form:

@example
texindex foo.??
@end example

@noindent
This command will run @code{texindex} on all the unsorted index files,
including any that you have defined yourself using @code{@@defindex}
or @code{@@defcodeindex}.  (You may execute @samp{texindex foo.??}
even if there are similarly named files with two letter extensions
that are not index files, such as @samp{foo.el}.  The @code{texindex}
command reports but otherwise ignores such files.)

For each file specified, @code{texindex} generates a sorted index file
whose name is made by appending @samp{s} to the input file name.  The
@code{@@printindex} command looks for a file with that name
(@pxref{Printing Indices & Menus}).  @code{texindex} does not alter the
raw index output file.

After you have sorted the indices, you need to rerun @code{tex} on the
Texinfo file.  This regenerates the DVI file, this time with
up-to-date index entries.

Finally, you may need to run @code{tex} one more time, to get the page
numbers in the cross-references correct.

To summarize, this is a five step process:

@enumerate
@item
Run @code{tex} on your Texinfo file.  This generates a DVI file (with
undefined cross-references and no indices), and the raw index files
(with two letter extensions).

@item
Run @code{texindex} on the raw index files.  This creates the
corresponding sorted index files (with three letter extensions).

@item
Run @code{tex} again on your Texinfo file.  This regenerates the DVI
file, this time with indices and defined cross-references, but with page
numbers for the cross-references from last time, generally incorrect.

@item
Sort the indices again, with @code{texindex}.

@item
Run @code{tex} one last time.  This time the correct page numbers are
written for the cross-references.
@end enumerate

@pindex texi2dvi
Alternatively, it's a one-step process: run @code{texi2dvi}
(@pxref{Format with texi2dvi}).

You need not run @code{texindex} each time after you run @code{tex}.  If
you do not, on the next run, the @code{tex} formatting command will use
whatever sorted index files happen to exist from the previous use of
@code{texindex}.  This is usually ok while you are debugging.

@cindex Auxiliary files, avoiding
@findex novalidate
@cindex Pointer validation, suppressing
@cindex Chapters, formatting one at a time
Sometimes you may wish to print a document while you know it is
incomplete, or to print just one chapter of a document.  In that case,
the usual auxiliary files that @TeX{} creates and warnings @TeX{} gives
when cross-references are not satisfied are just nuisances.  You can
avoid them with the @code{@@novalidate} command, which you must give
@emph{before} the @code{@@setfilename} command
(@pxref{setfilename,,@code{@@setfilename}}).  Thus, the beginning of
your file would look approximately like this:

@example
\input texinfo
@@novalidate
@@setfilename myfile.info
@dots{}
@end example

@noindent @code{@@novalidate} also turns off validation in
@code{makeinfo}, just like its @code{--no-validate} option
(@pxref{Pointer Validation}).


@node Format with texi2dvi
@section Format with @code{texi2dvi}
@pindex texi2dvi @r{(shell script)}

The @code{texi2dvi} command automatically runs both @TeX{} and
@command{texindex} as many times as necessary to produce a DVI file
with sorted indices and all cross-references resolved.  It is
therefore simpler than manually executing the
@code{tex}---@code{texindex}---@code{tex}---@code{tex} sequence
described in the previous section.

To run @code{texi2dvi} on an input file @file{foo.texi}, do this (where
@samp{prompt$ } is your shell prompt):

@example
prompt$ @kbd{texi2dvi foo.texi}
@end example

As shown in this example, the input filenames to @code{texi2dvi} must
include any extension (@samp{.texi}, @samp{.texinfo}, etc.).  Under
MS-DOS and perhaps in other circumstances, you may need to run @samp{sh
texi2dvi foo.texi} instead of relying on the operating system to invoke
the shell on the @samp{texi2dvi} script.

@opindex --command @r{(@command{texi2dvi})}
One useful option to @code{texi2dvi} is @samp{--command=@var{cmd}}.
This inserts @var{cmd} on a line by itself after the
@code{@@setfilename} in a temporary copy of the input file before
running @TeX{}.  With this, you can specify different printing
formats, such as @code{@@smallbook} (@pxref{smallbook}),
@code{@@afourpaper} (@pxref{A4 Paper}), or @code{@@pagesizes}
(@pxref{pagesizes}), without actually changing the document source.
(You can also do this on a site-wide basis with @file{texinfo.cnf};
@pxref{Preparing for TeX,,Preparing for @TeX{}}).

@opindex --pdf @r{(@command{texi2dvi})}
With the @option{--pdf} option, @command{texi2dvi} produces PDF output
instead of DVI (@pxref{PDF Output}), by running @command{pdftex}
instead of @command{tex}.  Alternatively, the command
@command{texi2pdf} is an abbreviation for running @samp{texi2dvi
--pdf}.  The command @command{pdftexi2dvi} is also supported as a
convenience to AUC-@TeX{} users, since the latter merely prepends
@samp{pdf} to DVI producing tools to have PDF producing tools.

@cindex @LaTeX{}, processing with @command{texi2dvi}
@command{texi2dvi} can also be used to process @LaTeX{} files; simply
run @samp{texi2dvi filename.ext}.

@opindex --language @r{(@command{texi2dvi})}
Normally @command{texi2dvi} is able to guess the input file language
by its contents and file name suffix. If, however, it fails to do so
you can specify the input language using
@option{--language=@var{lang}} command line option, where @var{lang}
is either @samp{latex} or @samp{texinfo}.

@command{texi2dvi} will use @command{etex} (or @command{pdfetex}) if
they are available; these extended versions of @TeX{} are not
required, and the DVI (or PDF) output is identical, but they simplify
the @TeX{} programming in some cases, and provide additional tracing
information when debugging @file{texinfo.tex}.

@opindex --translate-file @r{(@command{texi2dvi})}
Several options are provided for handling documents, written in
character sets other than ASCII. The
@option{--translate-file=@var{file}} option instructs
@command{texi2dvi} to translate input into internal @TeX{} character
set using @dfn{translation file} @var{file} (@pxref{TCX files, TCX
files, TCX files: Character translations, web2c, Web2c: A @TeX{}
implementation}).

@opindex --recode @r{(@command{texi2dvi})}
The options @option{--recode} and @option{--recode-from=@var{enc}}
allow conversion of an input document before running @TeX{}. The
@option{--recode} option recodes the document from encoding specified
by @samp{@@documentencoding} command
(@pxref{documentencoding,,@code{documentencoding}}) to plain 7-bit
@samp{texinfo} encoding.

@opindex --recode-from @r{(@command{texi2dvi})}
The option @option{--recode-from=@var{enc}} recodes the document from
@var{enc} encoding to the encoding specified by
@samp{@@documentencoding}. This is useful, for example, if the
document is written in @samp{UTF-8} encoding and an equivalent 8-bit
encoding is supported by @command{makeinfo}.

Both @option{--recode} and @option{--recode-from=@var{enc}} use
@command{recode} utility to perform the conversion. If
@command{recode} fails to process the file, @command{texi2dvi} prints
a warning and continues, using the unmodified input file.

The option @option{-E} (equivalently, @option{-e} and
@option{--expand}) does Texinfo macro expansion using
@command{makeinfo} instead of the @TeX{} implementation.  Each
implementation has its own limitations and advantages.  If this option
is used, the string @code{@@c@tie{}_texi2dvi} must not appear at the
beginning of a line in the source file.

For the list of all options, run @samp{texi2dvi --help}.


@node Print with lpr
@section Shell Print Using @code{lpr -d}
@pindex lpr @r{(DVI print command)}

The precise command to print a DVI file depends on your system
installation.  Two common ones are @samp{dvips foo.dvi -o} and @samp{lpr
-d foo.dvi}.

For example, the following commands will (perhaps) suffice to sort the
indices, format, and print the @cite{Bison Manual}:

@example
@group
tex bison.texinfo
texindex bison.??
tex bison.texinfo
lpr -d bison.dvi
@end group
@end example

@noindent
(Remember that the shell commands may be different at your site; but
these are commonly used versions.)

Using the @code{texi2dvi} shell script (see the previous section):

@example
@group
texi2dvi bison.texinfo
lpr -d bison.dvi
# or perhaps dvips bison.dvi -o
@end group
@end example

@cindex Shell printing, on MS-DOS/MS-Windows
@cindex Printing DVI files, on MS-DOS/MS-Windows
@pindex lpr@r{-d, replacements on MS-DOS/MS-Windows}
@code{lpr} is a standard program on Unix systems, but it is usually
absent on MS-DOS/MS-Windows.  Some network packages come with a
program named @code{lpr}, but these are usually limited to sending files
to a print server over the network, and generally don't support the
@samp{-d} option.  If you are unfortunate enough to work on one of these
systems, you have several alternative ways of printing DVI files:

@itemize @bullet{}
@item Find and install a Unix-like @code{lpr} program, or its clone.
If you can do that, you will be able to print DVI files just like
described above.

@item Send the DVI files to a network printer queue for DVI files.
Some network printers have special queues for printing DVI files.  You
should be able to set up your network software to send files to that
queue.  In some cases, the version of @code{lpr} which comes with your
network software will have a special option to send a file to specific
queues, like this:

@example
lpr -Qdvi -hprint.server.domain bison.dvi
@end example

@item Convert the DVI file to a Postscript or PCL file and send it to your
local printer.  @xref{Invoking Dvips,,, dvips, Dvips}, and the man
pages for @code{dvilj}, for detailed description of these tools.  Once

directly, just send it to the appropriate port, usually @samp{PRN}.

@section Using the Local Variables List
@cindex Local variables
@cindex Compile command for formatting
@cindex Format with the compile command

Yet another way to apply the @TeX{} formatting command to a Texinfo file
is to put that command in a @dfn{local variables list} at the end of the
Texinfo file.  You can then specify the @code{tex} or @code{texi2dvi}
commands as a @code{compile-command} and have Emacs run it by typing
@kbd{M-x compile}.  This creates a special shell called the
@file{*compilation*} buffer in which Emacs runs the compile command.
For example, at the end of the @file{gdb.texinfo} file, after the
@code{@@bye}, you could put the following:@refill

@example
@group
Local Variables:
compile-command: "texi2dvi gdb.texinfo"
End:
@end group
@end example

@noindent
This technique is most often used by programmers who also compile programs
this way; see @ref{Compilation, , , emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}.@refill


@node Requirements Summary
@section @TeX{} Formatting Requirements Summary
@cindex Requirements for formatting
@cindex Minimal requirements for formatting
@cindex Formatting requirements

Every Texinfo file that is to be input to @TeX{} must begin with a
@code{\input} command and must contain an @code{@@setfilename} command:

@example
\input texinfo
@@setfilename @var{arg-not-used-by-@TeX{}}
@end example

@noindent
The first command instructs @TeX{} to load the macros it needs to
process a Texinfo file and the second command opens auxiliary files.

Every Texinfo file must end with a line that terminates @TeX{}'s
processing and forces out unfinished pages:

@example
@@bye
@end example

Strictly speaking, these lines are all a Texinfo file needs to be
processed successfully by @TeX{}.

Usually, however, the beginning includes an @code{@@settitle} command to
define the title of the printed manual, an @code{@@setchapternewpage}
command, a title page, a copyright page, and permissions.  Besides an
@code{@@bye}, the end of a file usually includes indices and a table of
contents.  (And of course most manuals contain a body of text as well.)

@cindex Initialization file for @TeX{} input

@TeX{} needs to know where to find the @file{texinfo.tex} file that the
@samp{\input texinfo} command on the first line reads.  The
@file{texinfo.tex} file tells @TeX{} how to handle @@-commands; it is
included in all standard GNU distributions.  The latest version is
always available from the Texinfo source repository:
@smalldisplay
@uref{http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/texinfo/texinfo/doc/texinfo.tex?rev=HEAD}
@end smalldisplay

@pindex texinfo.tex@r{, installing}

Usually, the installer has put the @file{texinfo.tex} file in the
default directory that contains @TeX{} macros when GNU Texinfo, Emacs or
other GNU software is installed.  In this case, @TeX{} will find the
file and you do not need to do anything special.  If this has not been
done, you can put @file{texinfo.tex} in the current directory when you
run @TeX{}, and @TeX{} will find it there.

@pindex epsf.tex@r{, installing}
Also, you should install @file{epsf.tex}, if it is not already installed
from another distribution.  More details are at the end of the description
of the @code{@@image} command (@pxref{Images}).

@cindex European Computer Modern fonts, installing
@cindex EC fonts, installing
@cindex CM-Super fonts, installing
To be able to use quotation marks other than those used in English
you'll need to install European Computer Modern fonts and optionally
CM-Super fonts, unless they are already installed (@pxref{Inserting
Quotation Marks}).

@pindex feymr10@r{, installing}
@cindex Euro font, installing
If you intend to use the @code{@@euro} command, you should install the
Euro font, if it is not already installed.  @xref{euro}.

@pindex texinfo.cnf @r{installation}
@cindex Customizing of @TeX{} for Texinfo
@cindex Site-wide Texinfo configuration file
Optionally, you may create an additional @file{texinfo.cnf}, and install
it as well.  This file is read by @TeX{} when the @code{@@setfilename}
command is executed (@pxref{setfilename,, @code{@@setfilename}}).  You can put any
commands you like there, according to local site-wide conventions.  They
will be read by @TeX{} when processing any Texinfo document.  For
example, if @file{texinfo.cnf} contains the line @samp{@@afourpaper}
(@pxref{A4 Paper}), then all Texinfo documents will be processed with
that page size in effect.  If you have nothing to put in
@file{texinfo.cnf}, you do not need to create it.

@cindex Environment variable @code{TEXINPUTS}
@vindex TEXINPUTS
If neither of the above locations for these system files suffice for
you, you can specify the directories explicitly.  For
@file{texinfo.tex}, you can do this by writing the complete path for the
file after the @code{\input} command.  Another way, that works for both
@file{texinfo.tex} and @file{texinfo.cnf} (and any other file @TeX{}
might read), is to set the @code{TEXINPUTS} environment variable in your
@file{.cshrc} or @file{.profile} file.

Which you use of @file{.cshrc} or @file{.profile} depends on
whether you use a Bourne shell-compatible (@code{sh}, @code{bash},
@code{ksh}, @dots{}) or C shell-compatible (@code{csh}, @code{tcsh})
command interpreter.  The latter read the @file{.cshrc} file for
initialization information, and the former read @file{.profile}.

In a @file{.cshrc} file, you could use the following @code{csh} command
sequence:

@example
setenv TEXINPUTS .:/home/me/mylib:
@end example

@need 1000
In a @file{.profile} file, you could use the following @code{sh} command
sequence:

@example
@group
TEXINPUTS=.:/home/me/mylib:
export TEXINPUTS
@end group
@end example

On MS-DOS/MS-Windows, you would say it like this@footnote{Note the use
of the @samp{;} character, instead of @samp{:}, as directory separator
on these systems.}:

@example
@group
set TEXINPUTS=.;d:/home/me/mylib;c:
@end group
@end example

@noindent
It is customary for DOS/Windows users to put such commands in the
@file{autoexec.bat} file, or in the Windows Registry.

@noindent
These settings would cause @TeX{} to look for @file{\input} file first
in the current directory, indicated by the @samp{.}, then in a
hypothetical user @samp{me}'s @file{mylib} directory, and finally in
the system directories.  (A leading, trailing, or doubled @samp{:}
indicates searching the system directories at that point.)

@cindex Dumping a .fmt file
@cindex Format file, dumping
Finally, you may wish to dump a @file{.fmt} file (@pxref{Memory dumps,,,
web2c, Web2c}) so that @TeX{} can load Texinfo faster.  (The
disadvantage is that then updating @file{texinfo.tex} requires
redumping.)  You can do this by running this command, assuming
@file{epsf.tex} is findable by @TeX{}:

@example
initex texinfo @@dump
@end example

@noindent
(@code{dump} is a @TeX{} primitive.)  Then, move @file{texinfo.fmt} to
wherever your @code{.fmt} files are found; typically, this will be in the
subdirectory @file{web2c} of your @TeX{} installation.


@node Overfull hboxes
@section Overfull ``hboxes''
@cindex Overfull @samp{hboxes}
@cindex @samp{hboxes}, overfull
@cindex Final output

@TeX{} is sometimes unable to typeset a line without extending it into
the right margin.  This can occur when @TeX{} comes upon what it
interprets as a long word that it cannot hyphenate, such as an
electronic mail network address or a very long title.  When this
happens, @TeX{} prints an error message like this:

@example
Overfull @@hbox (20.76302pt too wide)
@end example

@findex hbox
@noindent
(In @TeX{}, lines are in ``horizontal boxes'', hence the term, ``hbox''.
@samp{@@hbox} is a @TeX{} primitive not needed in the Texinfo language.)

@TeX{} also provides the line number in the Texinfo source file and
the text of the offending line, which is marked at all the places that
@TeX{} considered hyphenation.
@xref{Debugging with TeX, , Catching Errors with @TeX{} Formatting},
for more information about typesetting errors.

If the Texinfo file has an overfull hbox, you can rewrite the sentence
so the overfull hbox does not occur, or you can decide to leave it.  A
small excursion into the right margin often does not matter and may not
even be noticeable.

If you have many overfull boxes and/or an antipathy to rewriting, you
can coerce @TeX{} into greatly increasing the allowable interword
spacing, thus (if you're lucky) avoiding many of the bad line breaks,
like this:

@findex \emergencystretch
@example
@@tex
\global\emergencystretch = .9\hsize
@@end tex
@end example

@noindent
(You should adjust the fraction as needed.)  This huge value for
@code{\emergencystretch} cannot be the default, since then the typeset
output would generally be of noticeably lower quality; the default
is @samp{.15\hsize}.  @code{\hsize} is the @TeX{} dimension
containing the current line width.

@cindex Black rectangle in hardcopy
@cindex Rectangle, black in hardcopy
@cindex Box, ugly black in hardcopy
@cindex Ugly black rectangles in hardcopy
For what overfull boxes you have, however, @TeX{} will print a large,
ugly, black rectangle beside the line that contains the overfull hbox
unless told otherwise.  This is so you will notice the location of the
problem if you are correcting a draft.

@findex finalout
To prevent such a monstrosity from marring your final printout, write
the following in the beginning of the Texinfo file on a line of its own,
before the @code{@@titlepage} command:

@example
@@finalout
@end example


@node smallbook
@section Printing ``Small'' Books
@findex smallbook
@cindex Small book size
@cindex Book, printing small
@cindex Page sizes for books
@cindex Size of printed book

By default, @TeX{} typesets pages for printing in an 8.5 by 11 inch
format.  However, you can direct @TeX{} to typeset a document in a 7 by
9.25 inch format that is suitable for bound books by inserting the
following command on a line by itself at the beginning of the Texinfo
file, before the title page:@refill

@example
@@smallbook
@end example

@noindent
(Since many books are about 7 by 9.25 inches, this command might better
have been called the @code{@@regularbooksize} command, but it came to be
called the @code{@@smallbook} command by comparison to the 8.5 by 11
inch format.)

If you write the @code{@@smallbook} command between the
start-of-header and end-of-header lines, the Texinfo mode @TeX{}
region formatting command, @code{texinfo-tex-region}, will format the
region in ``small'' book size (@pxref{Start of Header}).@refill

You can tell @TeX{} to format a document for printing on European size
A4 paper (or A5) with the @code{@@afourpaper} (or @code{@@afivepaper})
command.  Write the command on a line by itself near the beginning of
the Texinfo file, before the title page.  For example, this is how you
would write the header for this manual:

@example

@cindex Height of text area
@cindex Depth of text area

You can explicitly specify the height and (optionally) width of the main
text area on the page with the @code{@@pagesizes} command.  Write this
on a line by itself near the beginning of the Texinfo file, before the
title page.  The height comes first, then the width if desired,
separated by a comma.  Examples:

@example
@@pagesizes 200mm,150mm  @c for b5 paper
@end example
@noindent and
@example
@@pagesizes 11.5in      @c for legal paper
@end example

@cindex B5 paper, printing on
@cindex Legal paper, printing on
This would be reasonable for printing on B5-size paper.  To emphasize,
this command specifies the size of the @emph{text area}, not the size of
the paper (which is 250@dmn{mm} by 177@dmn{mm} for B5, 14@dmn{in} by
8.5@dmn{in} for legal).

@cindex Margins on page, not controllable
To make more elaborate changes, such as changing any of the page
margins, you must define a new command in @file{texinfo.tex} (or
@file{texinfo.cnf}, @pxref{Preparing for TeX,,Preparing for @TeX{}}).

@xref{Format with texi2dvi}, and @ref{Preparing for TeX,,Preparing for

@findex cropmarks
@cindex Cropmarks for printing
@cindex Printing cropmarks
You can (attempt to) direct @TeX{} to print cropmarks at the corners of
pages with the @code{@@cropmarks} command.  Write the @code{@@cropmarks}
command on a line by itself between @code{@@iftex} and @code{@@end
iftex} lines near the beginning of the Texinfo file, before the title
page, like this:@refill

@example
@group

@@cropmarks
@@end iftex
@end group
@end example

This command is mainly for printers that typeset several pages on one
sheet of film; but you can attempt to use it to mark the corners of a
book set to 7 by 9.25 inches with the @code{@@smallbook} command.
(Printers will not produce cropmarks for regular sized output that is
printed on regular sized paper.)  Since different printing machines work
in different ways, you should explore the use of this command with a
spirit of adventure.  You may have to redefine the command in
@file{texinfo.tex}.

@findex \mag @r{(raw @TeX{} magnification)}
@cindex Magnified printing
@cindex Larger or smaller pages
You can attempt to direct @TeX{} to typeset pages larger or smaller than
usual with the @code{\mag} @TeX{} command.  Everything that is typeset
is scaled proportionally larger or smaller.  (@code{\mag} stands for
``magnification''.)  This is @emph{not} a Texinfo @@-command, but is a
plain @TeX{} command that is prefixed with a backslash.  You have to
write this command between @code{@@tex} and @code{@@end tex}
(@pxref{Raw Formatter Commands}).

Follow the @code{\mag} command with an @samp{=} and then a number that
is 1000 times the magnification you desire.  For example, to print pages
at 1.2 normal size, write the following near the beginning of the
Texinfo file, before the title page:

@example
@group
@@tex
\mag=1200
@@end tex
@end group
@end example

With some printing technologies, you can print normal-sized copies that
look better than usual by giving a larger-than-normal master to your
print shop.  They do the reduction, thus effectively increasing the
resolution.

Depending on your system, DVI files prepared with a
nonstandard-@code{\mag} may not print or may print only with certain
magnifications.  Be prepared to experiment.


@node PDF Output
@section PDF Output
@cindex PDF output

@pindex pdftex
The simplest way to generate PDF output from Texinfo source is to run
the convenience script @command{texi2pdf} (or @command{pdftexi2dvi});
this simply executes the @command{texi2dvi} script with the
@option{--pdf} option (@pxref{Format with texi2dvi}).  If for some
reason you want to process the document by hand, simply run the
@command{pdftex} program instead of plain @command{tex}.  That is, run
@samp{pdftex foo.texi} instead of @samp{tex foo.texi}.

@dfn{PDF} stands for `Portable Document Format'. It was invented by
Adobe Systems some years ago for document interchange, based on their
PostScript language.  Related links:

At present, Texinfo does not provide
@samp{@@ifpdf} or @samp{@@pdf} commands as for the other output
formats, since PDF documents contain many internal links that would be
hard or impossible to get right at the Texinfo source level.

PDF files require special software to be displayed, unlike the plain
ASCII formats (Info, HTML) that Texinfo supports.  They also tend to
be much larger than the DVI files output by @TeX{} by default.
Nevertheless, a PDF file does define an actual typeset document in a
self-contained file, so it has its place.

@node Generic translator texi2any/makeinfo
@chapter A generic translator for Texinfo: @command{texi2any}/@command{makeinfo}

@command{texi2any} is a generic translator for Texinfo that can
produce different output formats and is highly customizable.  By
default, the formats that may be produced are:

@table @asis
@item Info (with @option{--info}),

@item HTML (with @option{--html}),

@item plain text (with @option{--plaintext}),

@item Docbook (with @option{--docbook}),

@item Texinfo XML (with @option{--xml}).
@end table

@command{makeinfo} is an alias of @command{texi2any}, and using this
command is the same as using @code{texi2any --info}.

Without any command line option, @command{texi2any} generates raw text
with minimal formatting, which may be suitable for further processing.
We do not recommend using this output format for actual documentation,
since it is so basic.  Instead, produce plain text with
@option{--plaintext}.

Beside these default formats, command line options to
@command{texi2any} can determine important aspects of the output.
Beyond that, initialization files provide an even finer degree of
control over the final output, including nearly every aspect not
specified in the Texinfo input file.  Initialization files are written
in Perl, like the main program, and anything which may be specified on
the command line may also be specified within a initialization file.

The rest of this chapter gives further details on the program.

@pindex makeinfo
@pindex texi2any

To process a Texinfo file, invoke @command{texi2any} or
@command{makeinfo} followed by the name of the Texinfo file.  Also
select the format you want to output with the appropriate command line
option (default is Info for @command{makeinfo}).  Thus, to create the
Info file for Bison, type one of the following to the shell:

@example
texi2any --info bison.texinfo
@end example

@noindent or

@example
makeinfo bison.texinfo
@end example

You can specify more than one input file name; each is processed in
turn.  If an input file name is @samp{-}, or no input file names at
all are given, standard input is read.

@anchor{makeinfo options}
@cindex @code{makeinfo} options
@cindex Options for @code{makeinfo}

The @command{texi2any}/@command{makeinfo} programs accept many
options.  Perhaps the most basic are those that change the output
format.  By default, @command{makeinfo} outputs Info files, while
@command{texi2any} outputs raw text with minimal formatting.

Each command line option is either a long name preceded by @samp{--}
or a single letter preceded by @samp{-}.  You can use abbreviations
for the long option names as long as they are unique.

For example, you could use the following shell command to create an Info
file for @file{bison.texinfo} in which each line is filled to only 68
columns:

@example
makeinfo --fill-column=68 bison.texinfo
@end example

You can write two or more options in sequence, like this:

@example
makeinfo --no-split --fill-column=70 @dots{}
@end example

@noindent
This would keep the Info file together as one possibly very long
file and would also set the fill column to 70.

The options are:

@table @code

@item --commands-in-node-names
@opindex --commands-in-node-names
This option now does nothing, but remains for compatibility.  (It used

by default.)

@item --conf-dir=@var{path}
@opindex --conf-dir=@var{path}
Prepend @var{path} to the directory search list for finding
customization files that may be loaded with @option{--init-file} (see
below).  @var{path} can be a single directory, or a list of several
directories separated by the usual path separator character (@samp{:}
on GNU and Unix systems, @samp{;} on MS-DOS/MS-Windows).

@item --css-include=@var{file}
@opindex --css-include

@item --css-ref=@var{url}

@item --fill-column=@var{width}
@itemx -f @var{width}
@opindex --fill-column=@var{width}
@opindex -f @var{width}
Specify the maximum number of columns in a line; this is the
right-hand edge of a line.  Paragraphs that are filled will be filled
to this width.  (Filling is the process of breaking up and connecting
lines so that lines are the same length as or shorter than the number
specified as the fill column.  Lines are broken between words.) The
default value is 72.

@item --footnote-style=@var{style}
@itemx -s @var{style}
@opindex --footnote-style=@var{style}
@opindex -s @var{style}
Set the footnote style to @var{style}: either @samp{end} for the end
node style (the default) or @samp{separate} for the separate node
style.  The value set by this option overrides the value set in a
Texinfo file by an @code{@@footnotestyle} command (@pxref{Footnote
Styles}).

When the footnote style is @samp{separate}, @code{makeinfo} makes a
new node containing the footnotes found in the current node.  When the
footnote style is @samp{end}, @code{makeinfo} places the footnote
references at the end of the current node.

In HTML, when the footnote style is @samp{end}, or if the output is
not split, footnotes are put at the end of the output.  If set to
@samp{separate}, and the output is split, they are placed in a
separate file.

@opindex --html
Generate HTML output.  By default, the HTML output is split into one
output file per Texinfo source node, and the split output is written
into a subdirectory based on the name of the top-level Info file.
@xref{Generating HTML}.

@item -I @var{dir}
@opindex -I @var{dir}
Append @var{dir} to the directory search list for finding files that
are included using the @code{@@include} command.  By default,
@code{makeinfo} searches only the current directory.  If @var{dir} is
not given, the current directory @file{.} is appended.  Note that
@var{dir} can actually be a list of several directories separated by the
usual path separator character (@samp{:} on Unix, @samp{;} on
MS-DOS/MS-Windows).

@item --ifdocbook
@opindex --ifdocbook
@itemx --ifhtml
@opindex --ifhtml
@itemx --ifinfo
@opindex --ifinfo
@itemx --ifplaintext
@opindex --ifplaintext
@itemx --iftex
@opindex --iftex
@itemx --ifxml
@opindex --ifxml
For the given format, process @samp{@@if@var{format}} and
@samp{@@@var{format}} commands, and do not process
@samp{@@ifnot@var{format}}, even if not generating the given output
format.  For instance, if @option{--iftex} is specified, then
@samp{@@iftex} and @samp{@@tex} blocks will be read, and
@samp{@@ifnottex} blocks will be ignored, even if @TeX{} is not being
run.

@item --info
@opindex --info
Generate Info output.  By default, if the output file contains more
than about 300,000 bytes, it is split into shorter @dfn{indirect}
subfiles of about that size.  The name of the output file and of the
indirect subfiles is determined by @code{@@setfilename}
(@pxref{setfilename}).  @xref{Tag and Split Files}.

@item --init-file=@var{file}
@opindex --init-file=@var{file}
Load @var{file} as code to modify the behavior and output of the
generated manual.  It is customary to use the @code{.init} extension
for these customization files, but that is not enforced by anything;
the @var{file} name is taken literally.  @option{--conf-dir} (see
above) may be used to add to the list of directories in which these
customization files are searched for.  @xref{Loading initialization
files}.

@item --internal-links=@var{file}
@opindex --internal-links=@var{file}
In HTML mode, output a tab separated file containing three columns:
the internal link to an indexed item or item in the table of contents,
the name of the index (or table of contents) in which it occurs, and
the term which was indexed or entered.  This can be useful for
post-processors.

@item --macro-expand=@var{file}
@itemx -E @var{file}
@opindex --macro-expand=@var{file}
@opindex -E @var{file}
Output the Texinfo source with all the macros expanded to the named
file.  Normally, the results of macro expansion are used internally by
@code{makeinfo} and then discarded.  This option can be used by
@command{texi2dvi}.

@item --no-headers
@opindex --no-headers
@cindex Node separators, omitting
@cindex Generating plain text files
@cindex Menus, omitting
Do not include menus or node separator lines in the output.

When generating Info, this is the same as using @option{--plaintext},
resulting in a simple plain text file.  Furthermore,
@code{@@setfilename} is ignored, and output is to standard output
unless overridden with @option{-o}.  (This behavior is for backward
compatibility.)

@cindex Navigation links, omitting
When generating HTML, and output is split, also output navigation
links only at the beginning of each file.  If output is not split, do
not include navigation links at the top of each node at all.
@xref{Generating HTML}.

@item --no-ifdocbook
@opindex --no-ifdocbook
@itemx --no-ifhtml
@opindex --no-ifhtml
@itemx --no-ifinfo
@opindex --no-ifinfo
@itemx --no-ifplaintext
@opindex --no-ifplaintext
@itemx --no-iftex
@opindex --no-iftex
@itemx --no-ifxml
@opindex --no-ifxml
For the given format, do not process @samp{@@if@var{format}} and
@samp{@@@var{format}} commands, and do process
@samp{@@ifnot@var{format}}, even if generating the given format.  For
instance, if @option{--no-ifhtml} is specified, then @samp{@@ifhtml}
and @samp{@@html} blocks will not be read, and @samp{@@ifnothtml}
blocks will be.

@item --no-number-footnotes
@opindex --no-number-footnotes
Suppress automatic footnote numbering.  By default, footnotes are
numbered sequentially within a node, i.e., the current footnote number
is reset to 1 at the start of each node.

@item --no-number-sections
@itemx --number-sections
@opindex --no-number-sections
@opindex --number-sections
With @option{--number_sections} (the default), output chapter,
section, and appendix numbers as in printed manuals.  This works only
with hierarchically-structured manuals.  You should specify
@code{--no-number-sections} if your manual is not normally structured.

@item --no-pointer-validate
@itemx --no-validate
@opindex --no-pointer-validate
@opindex --no-validate
@cindex Pointer validation, suppressing
Suppress the pointer-validation phase of @code{makeinfo}---a dangerous
thing to do.  This can also be done with the @code{@@novalidate}
command (@pxref{Use TeX,,Use @TeX{}}).  Normally, after a Texinfo file
is processed, some consistency checks are made to ensure that cross
references can be resolved, etc.  @xref{Pointer Validation}.

@item --no-warn
@opindex --no-warn
Suppress warning messages (but not error messages).

@item --node-files
@itemx --no-node-files
@opindex --node-files
@opindex --no-node-files
When generating HTML, create redirection files for anchors and for any
nodes that are not already output with the name corresponding to the
node name (@pxref{HTML Xref Node Name Expansion}).  This option makes
it possible for section- and chapter-level cross-manual references to
succeed (@pxref{HTML Xref Configuration}).

This is set by default if the output is split.  If the output is not
split, @option{--node-files} enables the creation of the redirection
files, in addition to the monolithic main output file.
@option{--no-node-files} suppresses the creation of redirection files
in any case.  This option has no effect with any output format other
than HTML.  @xref{Generating HTML}.

@item --output=@var{file}
@itemx -o @var{file}
@opindex --output=@var{file}
@opindex -o @var{file}
Specify that the output should be directed to @var{file}.  This
overrides any file name specified in a @code{@@setfilename} command
found in the Texinfo source.  If neither @code{@@setfilename} nor this
option are specified, the input file name is used to determine the
output name.  @xref{setfilename,,@code{@@setfilename}}.

If @var{file} is @samp{-}, output goes to standard output and
@samp{--no-split} is implied.

If @var{file} is a directory or ends with a @samp{/} the usual rules
are used to determine the actual output file name (use
@code{@@setfilename} or the input file name) but these files are are
written to the @var{file} directory.  For example, @samp{makeinfo -o
bar/ foo.texi}, with or without @option{--no-split}, will write
@file{bar/foo.info}, and possibly other files under @file{bar/}.

When generating HTML, if output is split, @var{file} is used as the
name for the directory into which all files are written.  For example,
@samp{makeinfo -o bar --html foo.texi} will write 
@file{bar/index.html}, among other files.

@item -P @var{dir}
@opindex -P @var{dir}
Prepend @var{dir} to the directory search list for @code{@@include}.
If @var{dir} is not given, the current directory @file{.} is prepended.
See @samp{-I} for more details.

@item --paragraph-indent=@var{indent}
@itemx -p @var{indent}
@opindex --paragraph-indent=@var{indent}
@opindex -p @var{indent}
Set the paragraph indentation style to @var{indent}.  The value set by
this option overrides the value set in a Texinfo file by an
@code{@@paragraphindent} command (@pxref{paragraphindent}).  The value
of @var{indent} is interpreted as follows:

@table @asis
@item @samp{asis}
Preserve any existing indentation at the starts of paragraphs.

@item @samp{0} or @samp{none}
Delete any existing indentation.

@item @var{num}
Indent each paragraph by @var{num} spaces.
@end table

@item --plaintext
@opindex --plaintext
@cindex Plain text output
@cindex ASCII text output
@cindex Generating plain text files
@cindex @file{INSTALL} file, generating
@cindex Node separators, omitting
@cindex Menus, omitting
Output a plain text file: do not include menus or node separator lines
in the output.  This results in a straightforward plain text file that
you can (for example) send in email without complications, or include
in a distribution (for example, an @file{INSTALL} file).

With this option, @code{@@setfilename} is ignored and the output goes
to standard output by default; this can be overridden with @option{-o}.

@item --set-init-variable @var{var}=@var{value}
@opindex --set-init-variable @var{var}=@var{value}
Set the configuration variable @var{var} to @var{value}.  Many aspects
of the behavior and output may be modified by modifying configuration
variables, beyond what can be set in the document by @@-commands and
with other command line switches.  @xref{makeinfo Configuration
Variables}.

@item --split=@var{how}
@itemx --no-split
@opindex --split=@var{how}
@opindex --no-split
@cindex Splitting of output files
@cindex Output file splitting
@anchor{Splitting output}
@c
When generating Info, by default large output files are split into
smaller subfiles, of approximately 300k bytes.  When generating HTML,
by default each output file contains one node (@pxref{Generating
HTML}).  @option{--no-split} suppresses this splitting of the output.

On the other hand, @option{--split=@var{how}} may be used to specify
at which level the resulting document should be split.  The possible
values for @var{how} are:

@table @samp
@item chapter
The output is split at @code{@@chapter} and other sectioning
@@-commands at this level (@code{@@appendix}, etc.).

@item section
The output is split at @code{@@section} and other sectioning
@@-commands at this level.

@item node
The output is split at every node.  This is the default.
@end table

@item --split-size=@var{num}
@opindex --split-size=@var{num}
Keep Info files to at most @var{num} characters; default is 300,000.

@item --transliterate-file-names
@opindex --transliterate-file-names
Enable transliteration of 8-bit characters in node names for the
purpose of file name creation.  @xref{HTML Xref 8-bit Character Expansion}.

@item -U @var{var}
Cause @var{var} to be undefined.  This is equivalent to
@code{@@clear @var{var}} in the Texinfo file (@pxref{set clear value}).

@item --verbose
@opindex --verbose
Cause @code{makeinfo} to display messages saying what it is doing.
Normally, @code{makeinfo} only outputs messages if there are errors or
warnings.

@item --version
@itemx -V
@opindex --version
@opindex -V
Print the version number, then exit successfully.

@item --xml
@opindex --xml
Generate XML output rather than Info.

@end table

@vindex TEXINFO_OUTPUT_FORMAT
@cindex Environment variable @code{TEXINFO_OUTPUT_FORMAT}
@command{makeinfo} also reads the environment variable
@env{TEXINFO_OUTPUT_FORMAT} to determine the output format, if not
overridden by a command line option.  The possible values are:

@example
docbook  html  info  plaintext  xml
@end example

If not set, Info output is the default.


@node Pointer Validation
@section Pointer Validation
@cindex Pointer validation with @code{makeinfo}
@cindex Validation of pointers

If you do not suppress pointer validation with the @samp{--no-validate}
option or the @code{@@novalidate} command in the source file (@pxref{Use
TeX,,Use @TeX{}}), @code{makeinfo} will check the validity of the
Texinfo file.  Mostly, this means ensuring that nodes you have referenced
really exist.  Here is a complete list of what is checked:

@enumerate
@item
If a `Next', `Previous', or `Up' node reference is a reference to a
node in the current file and is not an external reference such as to
@file{(dir)}, then the referenced node must exist.@refill

@item
In every node, if the `Previous' node is different from the `Up' node,
then the node pointed to by the `Previous' field must have a `Next'
field which points back to this node.@refill

@item
Every node except the `Top' node must have an `Up' pointer.@refill

@item
The node referenced by an `Up' pointer must itself reference the current
node through a menu item, unless the node referenced by `Up'
has the form `(@var{file})'.

@item
If the `Next' reference of a node is not the same as the `Next' reference
of the `Up' reference, then the node referenced by the `Next' pointer
must have a `Previous' pointer that points back to the current node.
This rule allows the last node in a section to point to the first node
of the next chapter.

@item
Every node except `Top' should be referenced by at least one other node,
either via the `Previous' or `Next' links, or via a menu or a
cross-reference.
@end enumerate


@node makeinfo Configuration Variables
@section @code{makeinfo} Configuration Variables

@cartouche
@quotation Warning
These configuration variable names and meanings may change in any
Texinfo release.  We try to avoid incompatible changes, but we cannot
promise.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

Many aspects of the behavior and output may be modified by modifying 
configuration variables. 
The Configuration variables are either
@itemize @bullet
@item associated with @@-commands in the document,
for example @code{@@documentlanguage},
@item associated with command-line options, for example the configuration
variable @code{SPLIT} is
associated with the @option{--split} command-line switch,
@item other 
configuration variables, for example @code{NO_CSS} which may be set to 0
in case one does not want CSS. Those configuration variables may always be set
on the command-line, using
@example
--set-init-variable 'VAR_NAME value'
@end example
or
@example
--set-init-variable VAR_NAME=value
@end example

where @var{VAR_NAME} is the variable name, for example @code{SPLIT} or
@code{NO_CSS}, and @var{value} is the value of the variable. A special
value is @samp{undef} the sets the variable to this special @command{perl}
value.
@end itemize

The list of configuration variables associated with @@-commands is
in @ref{Configuration variables for @@-commands}, the list and mapping
of configuration variables associated with command line options is at 
@ref{Configuration variables and options}.

The other configuration variables are:

@vtable @code
@item DEBUG
The integer value specifies what kind of debugging output is generated.
It is a bitmask. Setting it to 255 ensures having all the debugging
set.
@item FRAMES
For HTML. If set, a file describing the frame layout is generated, 
together with a file with the short table of contents.
@item DOCTYPE
For HTML, XML, Docbook.
The SystemLiteral, the entity's system identifier.  It is a URI, which 
may be used to retrieve the entity, and it identifies the canonical DTD 
for the document.
@item FRAMESET_DOCTYPE
For HTML.  Same as DOCTYPE, but for the file containing the frame description.
@item TEST
If this value is true, some variables which should be dynamically generated
(the date, the program name, the version) are set to fixed and given values. 
This is usefull in case the resulting manual is compared with a reference. 
For example this is used in the tests.
@item DUMP_TEXI
Mainly useful for debugging.  If set, the result of the first pass is
put in @file{<document name>.passtexi}, the result of the second pass is 
put in @file{<document name>.passfirst}.
@item TOP_FILE
This file name may be used for the top-level file.  The extension is set 
appropriately, if necessary. This is used to override the default, and is, in
general only taken into account when split.
@item TOC_FILE
This file name is used for the table of contents.  The extension is set 
appropriately, if necessary.  It is only used if split and 
@code{INLINE_CONTENTS} is not set.  Default is @file{<document name>_toc.html}.
@item SHOW_MENU
If set, the Texinfo menus are shown.  It is set in all the formats, for 
example it is set for HTML (except if @option{--no-headers} is used),
Info and XML, but not for Docbook.
@item USE_NODES
Use nodes preferentially to decide where elements are separated.
@item USE_SECTIONS
Use sectioning @@-commands preferentially to decide where elements are 
separated.
@item TOC_LINKS
For HTML. If set links from headings to toc entries are created.
@item SHORTEXTN
The default extension is set to @samp{.htm}.
@item PREFIX
This set the output file prefix, that may be prepended to some output 
files.  In the default case it is set by @code{@@setfilename} or from
the input file (@pxref{setfilename}).  How this value is used depends
on the value of other configuration variables or command line options,
like split, @code{NODE_FILENAMES}.
@item SHORT_REF
For HTML.  If this is set internal cross-references are given without the 
@samp{section} word, even if the target of the reference is a section.
@item IDX_SUMMARY
If set, for each @code{@@printindex}, a file @file{<document name>_<index name>.idx}
is created which contains lines of the form
@example
@var{key} @var{reference}
@end example
sorted alphabetically (case matters).
@item DEF_TABLE
For HTML.  If this is set a table construction for @code{@@deffn} and similar
@@-commands is used (looking more like @TeX{} output), instead of 
definition lists.
@item L2H
For HTML.  If set, @command{latex2html} is used to convert @code{@@math}
and @code{@@tex} sections.  Best used with @option{--iftex}.
@item L2H_L2H
Program invoked as @command{latex2html} if @code{L2H} is set.
@item L2H_SKIP
Relevant only is @code{L2H} is set. 
If this is set the actual call to @command{latex2html} is skipped. 
The previously generated content is reused, instead.
If set to 0, the cache is not used.
If undef the cache is used for as many @TeX{} fragments as possible
and for the remaining the command is run.
@item L2H_TMP
Relevant only is @code{L2H} is set.  Set the directory used for temporary 
files. The path leading to this directory may not contain a dot 
@samp{.} otherwise, @command{latex2html} will fail (because of dvips).
@item L2H_FILE
Relevant only is @code{L2H} is set. 
If set, this file is sued as @command{latex2html} init file.
@item L2H_CLEAN
Relevant only is @code{L2H} is set. 
if this is set the intermediate files generated in relation with
@code{L2H} with @command{latex2html} are cleaned.
@item L2H_HTML_VERSION
Relevant only is @code{L2H} is set.
The HTML version used in the @command{latex2html} call.
@item MONOLITHIC
For HTML.  Output only one file including the table of content. 
It only makes sense when not split, and it is set in the default case.
@item IGNORE_PREAMBLE_TEXT
If this is set the text before @@node and sectioning commands is ignored.
This is a backward compatibility configuration variable you certainly 
shouldn't use.
@item EXTERNAL_DIR
For HTML.
Base directory for external manuals. You shouldn't use this variable,
but instead use the mechanism described in @ref{HTML Xref Configuration}.
@item USE_ISO
For HTML.
Use entities for doubled single-quote characters (@pxref{Inserting Quotation Marks}, @samp{---} and @samp{--} 
(@pxref{Conventions, General Syntactic Conventions}).
@item SPLIT_INDEX
For HTML.
If set, document is split, and a @code{@@printindex} happens in a sectioning 
element at the level of splitting, then split index pages at the next letter
after they have more than that many entries. If set to 0, no index splitting.
@item IN_ENCODING
Input file encoding using perl encoding names. Set according to 
@code{@@documentencoding}.
@item USE_NLS
If set use Native Language Support support fully. In the default case, 
this is determined automatically at buildtime or at runtime.
@item VERTICAL_HEAD_NAVIGATION
For HTML.  
If set, a vertical navigation panel is used.
@item INLINE_CONTENTS
If set, output the contents where the @code{@@contents} and similar 
@@-commands are located. Ignored if @code{@@set*contentsaftertitlepage}
is set.
@item NODE_FILE_EXTENSION
Extension for node files if @code{NODE_FILENAMES} is set.
@item NO_CSS
For HTML.
Do not use CSS (@pxref{HTML CSS}).
@item INLINE_CSS_STYLE
For HTML.
Put CSS directly in HTML elements and not at the beginning of the file.
@item USE_TITLEPAGE_FOR_TITLE
Use the full @code{@@titlepage} as title, not a simple title.
@item SIMPLE_MENU
If set use simply a preformatted style for the menu, instead of breaking 
down the different parts of the menu. @xref{Menu Parts}.
@item EXTENSION
Extension added to the output file.
@item INLINE_INSERTCOPYING
If set @code{@@insertcopying} is replaced by the @code{@@copying}
content as if @code{@@insertcopying} was a user defined macro.
@item USE_NUMERIC_ENTITY
For in XML, HTML.
If set, use numeric entity when there is no corresponding textual entity.
@item I18N_PERL_HASH
If set use the old system for the translation of strings output by 
the program in the document.
@item ENABLE_ENCODING_USE_ENTITY
For HTMl and XML.
If @option{--enable-encoding} is set, but there is an entity corresponding
with the letter or the symbol being output, prefer the entity.
@item ICONS
For HTML.  Use icons for the navigation panel.
@item USE_UNICODE
Use perl support for unicode. This is automatically detected.
@item USE_UNIDECODE
Use the @code{Text::Unidecode} perl module to transliterate more characters.
This is automatically detected.
@item DATE_IN_HEADER
For HTML.
Put the document generation date in the header.
@item OPEN_QUOTE_SYMBOL
When an opening quote is needed, use the corresponding character.
@item CLOSE_QUOTE_SYMBOL
When a closing quote is needed, use the corresponding character.
@item TOP_NODE_UP
Up node for the Top node. Default is @samp{(dir)}.
@item TOP_NODE_FILE
File used for the Top node, if @code{NODE_FILENAMES} is set.
@item TOP_NODE_FILE_TARGET
File used for Top node in cross-reference.
@item SHOW_TITLE
For HTML.
If set, output the title at the beginning of the document.
@item WORDS_IN_PAGE
For HTML split at node.
Specifies the approximate
minimum page length required before a navigation panel
is placed at the bottom of a page.
@item HEADER_IN_TABLE
For HTML.
Use simple headers formatting, not in a table and using node names.
@item USE_ACCESSKEY
For HTML.
Use accesskey in cross-references.
@item USE_REL_REV
For HTML.
Use @code{rel} in cross-references.
@item USE_LINKS
For HTML.
generate @code{<link>} elements in HTML @code{<head>}.
@item OVERVIEW_LINK_TO_TOC
If set the cross-references in Overview link to the corresponding 
Table of Contents entry.
@item AVOID_MENU_REDUNDANCY
if set and menu entry equals menu description, then do not print 
menu description.
@item NODE_NAME_IN_MENU
If set, use node names in menu entries, otherwise prefer section names.
@item NODE_NAME_IN_INDEX
If set, use node names in index entries, otherwise prefer section names.
@item USE_SETFILENAME
If set, use @code{@@setfilename} to set document name, otherwise base the 
document name only on the input file name.  @xref{setfilename}.
@item USE_SETFILENAME_EXTENSION
Default for Info, not for other output.
If set use what @code{@@setfilename} gives for the output file name, 
including the extension.  You should not need to set this variable.
@item COMPLEX_FORMAT_IN_TABLE
For HTML.
If set, use table for indentation of complex formats.
@item USE_UP_FOR_ADJACENT_NODES
If set, try up sections to complete node directions.
@c @item TOP_HEADING_AT_BEGINNING
@item SEPARATE_DESCRIPTION
If set, always separate menu description and menu link, even in 
preformatted environment.
@item IGNORE_BEFORE_SETFILENAME
If set, begin outputting at @code{@@setfilename}, if @code{@@setfilename}
is present.
@item COMPLETE_IMAGE_PATHS
If set, the image files are completed to be relative from the
document directory, to the source manual directory and then to
the image.
@item USE_NODE_TARGET
If set, use the node associated with a section for section target in
cross-references.
@item NEW_CROSSREF_STYLE
If unset use an old cross-reference schema.  This is a backward compatibility
setting, you should certainly never unset this variable.
@item PROGRAM_NAME_IN_FOOTER
For HTML.
If set, output the program name and misc information in the pages footers.
@item NODE_FILENAMES
If set, node names are used to construct file names. In the 
default case, it is set if split at node, or @code{NODE_FILES} is set
and document is split.

@item DEFAULT_ENCODING
The default out file encoding.  Currently @samp{utf8} or @samp{ascii} for Info.

@item OUT_ENCODING
Output files encoding using perl encoding name.  In the default
case set auotmatically based on @code{@@documentencoding}.

@item ENCODING_NAME
Output document encoding. In the default case set automatically
based on @code{@@documentencoding}. This encoding name is
the classical charset name in HTML.

@item EXTERNAL_CROSSREF_SPLIT
For cross-references to other manuals, this determines if the other
manual is considered to be split or monolithic.  In the default case
set based on @code{SPLIT}. @xref{HTML Xref}, and see @ref{HTML Xref
Configuration}.

@item BODYTEXT
For HTML.  The text appearing in @code{<body>}.  Set automatically
taking into account the document language in the default case.

@item CSS_LINES

@node makeinfo advantages
@subsection @code{makeinfo} Preferred

The @code{makeinfo} utility creates an Info file from a Texinfo source
file more quickly than either of the Emacs formatting commands and
provides better error messages.  We recommend it.  @code{makeinfo} is a
C program that is independent of Emacs.  You do not need to run Emacs to
use @code{makeinfo}, which means you can use @code{makeinfo} on machines
that are too small to run Emacs.  You can run @code{makeinfo} in any one
of three ways: from an operating system shell, from a shell inside
Emacs, or by typing the @kbd{C-c C-m C-r} or the @kbd{C-c C-m C-b}
command in Texinfo mode in Emacs.

The @code{texinfo-format-region} and the @code{texinfo-format-buffer}
commands are useful if you cannot run @code{makeinfo}.  Also, in some
circumstances, they format short regions or buffers more quickly than
@code{makeinfo}.


@node makeinfo in Emacs
@subsection Running @code{makeinfo} Within Emacs
@cindex Running @code{makeinfo} in Emacs
@cindex @code{makeinfo} inside Emacs
@cindex Shell, running @code{makeinfo} in

You can run @code{makeinfo} in GNU Emacs Texinfo mode by using either the
@code{makeinfo-region} or the @code{makeinfo-buffer} commands.  In
Texinfo mode, the commands are bound to @kbd{C-c C-m C-r} and @kbd{C-c
C-m C-b} by default.@refill

@table @kbd
@item C-c C-m C-r
@itemx M-x makeinfo-region
Format the current region for Info.@refill
@findex makeinfo-region

@item C-c C-m C-b
@itemx M-x makeinfo-buffer
Format the current buffer for Info.@refill
@findex makeinfo-buffer
@end table

When you invoke @code{makeinfo-region} the output goes to a temporary
buffer.  When you invoke @code{makeinfo-buffer} output goes to the
file set with @code{@@setfilename} (@pxref{setfilename}).

The Emacs @code{makeinfo-region} and @code{makeinfo-buffer} commands
run the @code{makeinfo} program in a temporary shell buffer.  If
@code{makeinfo} finds any errors, Emacs displays the error messages in
the temporary buffer.@refill

@cindex Errors, parsing
@cindex Parsing errors
@findex next-error
You can parse the error messages by typing @kbd{C-x `}
(@code{next-error}).  This causes Emacs to go to and position the
cursor on the line in the Texinfo source that @code{makeinfo} thinks
caused the error.  @xref{Compilation, , Running @code{make} or
Compilers Generally, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}, for more
information about using the @code{next-error} command.@refill

In addition, you can kill the shell in which the @code{makeinfo}
command is running or make the shell buffer display its most recent
output.@refill

@table @kbd
@item C-c C-m C-k
@itemx M-x makeinfo-kill-job
@findex makeinfo-kill-job
Kill the current running @code{makeinfo} job
(from @code{makeinfo-region} or @code{makeinfo-buffer}).@refill

@item C-c C-m C-l
@itemx M-x makeinfo-recenter-output-buffer
@findex makeinfo-recenter-output-buffer
Redisplay the @code{makeinfo} shell buffer to display its most recent
output.@refill
@end table

@noindent
(Note that the parallel commands for killing and recentering a @TeX{}
job are @kbd{C-c C-t C-k} and @kbd{C-c C-t C-l}.  @xref{Texinfo Mode
Printing}.)@refill

You can specify options for @code{makeinfo} by setting the
@code{makeinfo-options} variable with either the @kbd{M-x
customize} or the @kbd{M-x set-variable} command, or by setting the
variable in your @file{.emacs} initialization file.

For example, you could write the following in your @file{.emacs} file:@refill

@example
@group
(setq makeinfo-options
     "--paragraph-indent=0 --no-split
      --fill-column=70 --verbose")
@end group
@end example

@node texinfo-format commands
@subsection The @code{texinfo-format@dots{}} Commands

In GNU Emacs in Texinfo mode, you can format part or all of a Texinfo
file with the @code{texinfo-format-region} command.  This formats the
current region and displays the formatted text in a temporary buffer
called @samp{*Info Region*}.@refill

Similarly, you can format a buffer with the
@code{texinfo-format-buffer} command.  This command creates a new
buffer and generates the Info file in it.  Typing @kbd{C-x C-s} will
save the Info file under the name specified by the
@code{@@setfilename} line which must be near the beginning of the
Texinfo file.@refill

@table @kbd
@item C-c C-e C-r
@itemx @code{texinfo-format-region}
@findex texinfo-format-region
Format the current region for Info.

@item C-c C-e C-b
@itemx @code{texinfo-format-buffer}
@findex texinfo-format-buffer
Format the current buffer for Info.
@end table

The @code{texinfo-format-region} and @code{texinfo-format-buffer}
commands provide you with some error checking, and other functions can
provide you with further help in finding formatting errors.  These
procedures are described in an appendix; see @ref{Catching Mistakes}.
However, the @code{makeinfo} program is often faster and
provides better error checking (@pxref{makeinfo in Emacs}).@refill

@node Batch Formatting
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@subsection Batch Formatting
@cindex Batch formatting for Info
@cindex Info batch formatting

You can format Texinfo files for Info using @code{batch-texinfo-format}
and Emacs Batch mode.  You can run Emacs in Batch mode from any shell,
including a shell inside of Emacs.  (@xref{Command Arguments,,,
emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}.)

Here is a shell command to format all the files that end in
@file{.texinfo} in the current directory:

@example
emacs -batch -funcall batch-texinfo-format *.texinfo
@end example

@noindent
Emacs processes all the files listed on the command line, even if an
error occurs while attempting to format some of them.@refill

Run @code{batch-texinfo-format} only with Emacs in Batch mode as shown;
it is not interactive.  It kills the Batch mode Emacs on completion.@refill

@code{batch-texinfo-format} is convenient if you lack @code{makeinfo}
and want to format several Texinfo files at once.  When you use Batch
mode, you create a new Emacs process.  This frees your current Emacs, so
you can continue working in it.  (When you run
@code{texinfo-format-region} or @code{texinfo-format-buffer}, you cannot
use that Emacs for anything else until the command finishes.)@refill

@node Tag and Split Files
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@subsection Tag Files and Split Files
@cindex Making a tag table automatically
@cindex Tag table, making automatically

If a Texinfo file has more than 30,000 bytes,
@code{texinfo-format-buffer} automatically creates a tag table
for its Info file; @code{makeinfo} always creates a tag table.  With
a @dfn{tag table}, Info can jump to new nodes more quickly than it can
otherwise.

@cindex Indirect subfiles
In addition, if the Texinfo file contains more than about 300,000
bytes, @code{texinfo-format-buffer} and @code{makeinfo} split the
large Info file into shorter @dfn{indirect} subfiles of about 300,000
bytes each.  Big files are split into smaller files so that Emacs does
not need to make a large buffer to hold the whole of a large Info
file; instead, Emacs allocates just enough memory for the small, split-off
file that is needed at the time.  This way, Emacs avoids wasting
memory when you run Info.  (Before splitting was implemented, Info
files were always kept short and @dfn{include files} were designed as
a way to create a single, large printed manual out of the smaller Info
files.  @xref{Include Files}, for more information.  Include files are
still used for very large documents, such as @cite{The Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual}, in which each chapter is a separate file.)@refill

When a file is split, Info itself makes use of a shortened version of
the original file that contains just the tag table and references to
the files that were split off.  The split-off files are called
@dfn{indirect} files.@refill

The split-off files have names that are created by appending @w{@samp{-1}},
@w{@samp{-2}}, @w{@samp{-3}} and so on to the file name specified by the
@code{@@setfilename} command.  The shortened version of the original file
continues to have the name specified by @code{@@setfilename}.@refill

At one stage in writing this document, for example, the Info file was saved
as the file @file{test-texinfo} and that file looked like this:@refill

@example
@group
Info file: test-texinfo,    -*-Text-*-
produced by texinfo-format-buffer
from file: new-texinfo-manual.texinfo

^_
Indirect:
test-texinfo-1: 102
test-texinfo-2: 50422
@end group
@group
test-texinfo-3: 101300
^_^L
Tag table:
(Indirect)
Node: overview^?104
Node: info file^?1271
@end group
@group
Node: printed manual^?4853
Node: conventions^?6855
@dots{}
@end group
@end example

@noindent
(But @file{test-texinfo} had far more nodes than are shown here.)  Each of
the split-off, indirect files, @file{test-texinfo-1},
@file{test-texinfo-2}, and @file{test-texinfo-3}, is listed in this file
after the line that says @samp{Indirect:}.  The tag table is listed after
the line that says @samp{Tag table:}. @refill

In the list of indirect files, the number following the file name
records the cumulative number of bytes in the preceding indirect files,
not counting the file list itself, the tag table, or the permissions
text in each file.  In the tag table, the number following the node name
records the location of the beginning of the node, in bytes from the
beginning of the (unsplit) output.

If you are using @code{texinfo-format-buffer} to create Info files,
you may want to run the @code{Info-validate} command.  (The
@code{makeinfo} command does such a good job on its own, you do not
need @code{Info-validate}.)  However, you cannot run the @kbd{M-x
Info-validate} node-checking command on indirect files.  For
information on how to prevent files from being split and how to
validate the structure of the nodes, see @ref{Using Info-validate}.

@end menu


@node Directory File
@subsection The Directory File @file{dir}

For Info to work, the @file{info} directory must contain a file that
serves as a top level directory for the Info system.  By convention,
this file is called @file{dir}.  (You can find the location of this file
within Emacs by typing @kbd{C-h i} to enter Info and then typing
@kbd{C-x C-f} to see the pathname to the @file{info} directory.)

The @file{dir} file is itself an Info file.  It contains the top level
menu for all the Info files in the system.  The menu looks like
this:@refill

@example
@group
* Menu:
* Info:    (info).     Documentation browsing system.
* Emacs:   (emacs).    The extensible, self-documenting
                      text editor.
* Texinfo: (texinfo).  With one source file, make
                      either a printed manual using
                      @@TeX@{@} or an Info file.
@dots{}
@end group
@end example

Each of these menu entries points to the `Top' node of the Info file
that is named in parentheses.  (The menu entry does not need to
specify the `Top' node, since Info goes to the `Top' node if no node
name is mentioned.  @xref{Other Info Files, , Nodes in Other Info
Files}.)@refill

Thus, the @samp{Info} entry points to the `Top' node of the
@file{info} file and the @samp{Emacs} entry points to the `Top' node
of the @file{emacs} file.@refill

In each of the Info files, the `Up' pointer of the `Top' node refers
back to the @code{dir} file.  For example, the line for the `Top'
node of the Emacs manual looks like this in Info:@refill

@example
File: emacs  Node: Top, Up: (DIR), Next: Distrib
@end example

@noindent
In this case, the @file{dir} file name is written in upper case
letters---it can be written in either upper or lower case.  This is not
true in general, it is a special case for @file{dir}.


@node New Info File
@subsection Listing a New Info File
@cindex Adding a new Info file
@cindex Listing a new Info file
@cindex New Info file, listing it in @file{dir} file
@cindex Info file, listing a new
@cindex @file{dir} file listing

To add a new Info file to your system, you must write a menu entry to
add to the menu in the @file{dir} file in the @file{info} directory.
For example, if you were adding documentation for GDB, you would write
the following new entry:@refill

@example
* GDB: (gdb).           The source-level C debugger.
@end example

@noindent
The first part of the menu entry is the menu entry name, followed by a
colon.  The second part is the name of the Info file, in parentheses,
followed by a period.  The third part is the description.

The name of an Info file often has a @file{.info} extension.  Thus, the
Info file for GDB might be called either @file{gdb} or @file{gdb.info}.
The Info reader programs automatically try the file name both with and
without @file{.info}@footnote{On MS-DOS/MS-Windows systems, Info will
try the @file{.inf} extension as well.}; so it is better to avoid
clutter and not to write @samp{.info} explicitly in the menu entry.  For
example, the GDB menu entry should use just @samp{gdb} for the file
name, not @samp{gdb.info}.


@node Other Info Directories
@subsection Info Files in Other Directories
@cindex Installing Info in another directory
@cindex Info installed in another directory
@cindex Another Info directory
@cindex @file{dir} files and Info directories

If an Info file is not in the @file{info} directory, there are three
ways to specify its location:@refill

@enumerate
@item
Write the pathname in the @file{dir} file as the second part of the menu.

@item
If you are using Emacs, list the name of the file in a second @file{dir}
file, in its directory; and then add the name of that directory to the
@code{Info-directory-list} variable in your personal or site
initialization file.

This variable tells Emacs where to look for @file{dir} files (the files
must be named @file{dir}).  Emacs merges the files named @file{dir} from
each of the listed directories.  (In Emacs version 18, you can set the
@code{Info-directory} variable to the name of only one
directory.)@refill

@item
Specify the Info directory name in the @code{INFOPATH} environment
variable in your @file{.profile} or @file{.cshrc} initialization file.
(Only you and others who set this environment variable will be able to
find Info files whose location is specified this way.)
@end enumerate

For example, to reach a test file in the @file{/home/bob/info}
directory, you could add an entry like this to the menu in the
standard @file{dir} file:@refill

@example
* Test: (/home/bob/info/info-test).  Bob's own test file.
@end example

@noindent
In this case, the absolute file name of the @file{info-test} file is
written as the second part of the menu entry.@refill

Alternatively, you could write the following in your @file{.emacs} file:

@vindex Info-directory-list
@example
@group
(require 'info)
(setq Info-directory-list
 (cons (expand-file-name "/home/bob/info")
       Info-directory-list))
@end group
@end example

This tells Emacs to merge the system @file{dir} file with the @file{dir}
file in @file{/home/bob/info}.  Thus, Info will list the
@file{/home/bob/info/info-test} file as a menu entry in the
@file{/home/bob/info/dir} file.  Emacs does the merging only when
@kbd{M-x info} is first run, so if you want to set
@code{Info-directory-list} in an Emacs session where you've already run
@code{info}, you must @code{(setq Info-dir-contents nil)} to force Emacs
to recompose the @file{dir} file.

@vindex INFOPATH
@cindex Environment variable @code{INFOPATH}
Finally, you can tell Info where to look by setting the @code{INFOPATH}
environment variable in your shell startup file, such as @file{.cshrc},
@file{.profile} or @file{autoexec.bat}.  If you use a Bourne-compatible
shell such as @code{sh} or @code{bash} for your shell command
interpreter, you set the @code{INFOPATH} environment variable in the
@file{.profile} initialization file; but if you use @code{csh} or
@code{tcsh}, you set the variable in the @file{.cshrc} initialization
file.  On MS-DOS/MS-Windows systems, you must set @code{INFOPATH} in
your @file{autoexec.bat} file or in the Registry.  Each type of shell
uses a different syntax.

@itemize @bullet
@item
In a @file{.cshrc} file, you could set the @code{INFOPATH}
variable as follows:@refill

@smallexample
setenv INFOPATH .:~/info:/usr/local/emacs/info
@end smallexample

@item
In a @file{.profile} file, you would achieve the same effect by
writing:@refill

@smallexample
INFOPATH=.:$HOME/info:/usr/local/emacs/info
export INFOPATH
@end smallexample

@item
@pindex autoexec.bat
In a @file{autoexec.bat} file, you write this command@footnote{Note the
use of @samp{;} as the directory separator, and a different syntax for
using values of other environment variables.}:

@smallexample
set INFOPATH=.;%HOME%/info;c:/usr/local/emacs/info
@end smallexample
@end itemize

@noindent
The @samp{.} indicates the current directory as usual.  Emacs uses the
@code{INFOPATH} environment variable to initialize the value of Emacs's
own @code{Info-directory-list} variable.  The stand-alone Info reader
merges any files named @file{dir} in any directory listed in the
@env{INFOPATH} variable into a single menu presented to you in the node
called @samp{(dir)Top}.

@cindex Colon, last in @env{INFOPATH}
However you set @env{INFOPATH}, if its last character is a
colon@footnote{On MS-DOS/MS-Windows systems, use semicolon instead.}, this
is replaced by the default (compiled-in) path.  This gives you a way to
augment the default path with new directories without having to list all
the standard places.  For example (using @code{sh} syntax):

@example
INFOPATH=/local/info:
export INFOPATH
@end example

@noindent
will search @file{/local/info} first, then the standard directories.
Leading or doubled colons are not treated specially.

@cindex @file{dir} file, creating your own
When you create your own @file{dir} file for use with
@code{Info-directory-list} or @env{INFOPATH}, it's easiest to start by
copying an existing @file{dir} file and replace all the text after the
@samp{* Menu:} with your desired entries.  That way, the punctuation and
special CTRL-_ characters that Info needs will be present.


@node Installing Dir Entries
@subsection Installing Info Directory Files

When you install an Info file onto your system, you can use the program
@code{install-info} to update the Info directory file @file{dir}.
Normally the makefile for the package runs @code{install-info}, just
after copying the Info file into its proper installed location.

@findex dircategory
@findex direntry
In order for the Info file to work with @code{install-info}, you include
the commands @code{@@dircategory} and
@code{@@direntry}@dots{}@code{@@end direntry} in the Texinfo source
file.  Use @code{@@direntry} to specify the menu entries to add to the
Info directory file, and use @code{@@dircategory} to specify which part
of the Info directory to put it in.  Here is how these commands are used
in this manual:

@smallexample
@@dircategory Texinfo documentation system
@@direntry
* Texinfo: (texinfo).           The GNU documentation format.
* install-info: (texinfo)Invoking install-info. @dots{}
@dots{}
@@end direntry
@end smallexample

Here's what this produces in the Info file:

@smallexample
INFO-DIR-SECTION Texinfo documentation system
START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY
* Texinfo: (texinfo).           The GNU documentation format.
* install-info: (texinfo)Invoking install-info. @dots{}
@dots{}
END-INFO-DIR-ENTRY
@end smallexample

@noindent
The @code{install-info} program sees these lines in the Info file, and
that is how it knows what to do.

Always use the @code{@@direntry} and @code{@@dircategory} commands near
the beginning of the Texinfo input, before the first @code{@@node}
command.  If you use them later on in the input, @code{install-info}
will not notice them.

@code{install-info} will automatically reformat the description of the
menu entries it is adding.  As a matter of convention, the description
of the main entry (above, @samp{The GNU documentation format}) should
start at column 32, starting at zero (as in
@code{what-cursor-position} in Emacs).  This will make it align with
most others.  Description for individual utilities best start in
column 48, where possible.  For more information about formatting see
the @samp{--calign}, @samp{--align}, and @samp{--max-width} options in
@ref{Invoking install-info}.

If you use @code{@@dircategory} more than once in the Texinfo source,
each usage specifies the `current' category; any subsequent
@code{@@direntry} commands will add to that category.

@cindex Free Software Directory

also removes menu entries from the @file{dir} file.  It's most often
run as part of software installation, or when constructing a @file{dir} file
for all manuals on a system.  Synopsis:

@example
install-info [@var{option}]@dots{} [@var{info-file} [@var{dir-file}]]
@end example

If @var{info-file} or @var{dir-file} are not specified, the options
(described below) that define them must be.  There are no compile-time
defaults, and standard input is never used.  @code{install-info} can
read only one Info file and write only one @file{dir} file per invocation.

@cindex @file{dir}, created by @code{install-info}
If @var{dir-file} (however specified) does not exist,
@code{install-info} creates it if possible (with no entries).

@cindex Compressed dir files, reading
@cindex XZ-compressed dir files, reading
@cindex Bzipped dir files, reading
@cindex LZMA-compressed dir files, reading
@cindex Dir files, compressed
If any input file is compressed with @code{gzip} (@pxref{Top,,,gzip,
Gzip}), @code{install-info} automatically uncompresses it for reading.
And if @var{dir-file} is compressed, @code{install-info} also
automatically leaves it compressed after writing any changes.  If
@var{dir-file} itself does not exist, @code{install-info} tries to
open @file{@var{dir-file}.gz}, @file{@var{dir-file}.xz},
@file{@var{dir-file}.bz2}, and @file{@var{dir-file}.lzma}, in that
order.

Options:

@table @code
@item --add-once
Specifies that the entry or entries will only be put into a single section.

@item --align=@var{column}
@opindex --align=@var{column}
Specifies the column that the second and subsequent lines of menu entry's
description will be formatted to begin at.  The default for this option is
@samp{35}.  It is used in conjunction with the @samp{--max-width} option.
@var{column} starts counting at 1.

@item --append-new-sections
Instead of alphabetizing new sections, place them at the end of the DIR file.

@item --calign=@var{column}
@opindex --calign=@var{column}
Specifies the column that the first line of menu entry's description will
be formatted to begin at.  The default for this option is @samp{33}.  It is
used in conjunction with the @samp{--max-width} option.
When the name of the menu entry exceeds this column, entry's description
will start on the following line.
@var{column} starts counting at 1.

@item --debug
@opindex --debug
Report what is being done.

@item --delete
@opindex --delete
Delete the entries in @var{info-file} from @var{dir-file}.  The file
name in the entry in @var{dir-file} must be @var{info-file} (except for
an optional @samp{.info} in either one).  Don't insert any new entries.
Any empty sections that result from the removal are also removed.

@item --description=@var{text}
@opindex --description=@var{text}
Specify the explanatory portion of the menu entry.  If you don't specify
a description (either via @samp{--entry}, @samp{--item} or this option),
the description is taken from the Info file itself.

@item --dir-file=@var{name}
@opindex --dir-file=@var{name}
Specify file name of the Info directory file.  This is equivalent to
using the @var{dir-file} argument.

@item --dry-run
@opindex --dry-run
Same as @samp{--test}.

@item --entry=@var{text}
@opindex --entry=@var{text}
Insert @var{text} as an Info directory entry; @var{text} should have the
form of an Info menu item line plus zero or more extra lines starting
with whitespace.  If you specify more than one entry, they are all
added.  If you don't specify any entries, they are determined from
information in the Info file itself.

@item --help
@opindex --help
Display a usage message with basic usage and all available options,
then exit successfully.

@item --info-file=@var{file}
@opindex --info-file=@var{file}
Specify Info file to install in the directory.  This is
equivalent to using the @var{info-file} argument.

@item --info-dir=@var{dir}
@opindex --info-dir=@var{dir}
Specify the directory where the directory file @file{dir} resides.
Equivalent to @samp{--dir-file=@var{dir}/dir}.

@item --infodir=@var{dir}
@opindex --infodir=@var{dir}
Same as @samp{--info-dir}.

@item --item=@var{text}
@opindex --item=@var{text}
Same as @samp{--entry=@var{text}}.  An Info directory entry is actually
a menu item.

@item --keep-old
@opindex --keep-old
Do not replace pre-existing menu entries.  When @samp{--remove} is specified,
this option means that empty sections are not removed.

@item --max-width=@var{column}
@opindex --max-width=@var{column}
Specifies the column that the menu entry's description will be word-wrapped
at.  @var{column} starts counting at 1.

@item --maxwidth=@var{column}
@opindex --maxwidth=@var{column}
Same as @samp{--max-width}.

@item --menuentry=@var{text}
@opindex --menuentry=@var{text}
Same as @samp{--name}.

@item --name=@var{text}
@opindex --name=@var{text}
Specify the name portion of the menu entry.  If the @var{text} does
not start with an asterisk @samp{*}, it is presumed to be the text
after the @samp{*} and before the parentheses that specify the Info
file.  Otherwise @var{text} is taken verbatim, and is taken as
defining the text up to and including the first period (a space is
appended if necessary).  If you don't specify the name (either via
@samp{--entry}, @samp{--item} or this option), it is taken from the
Info file itself.  If the Info does not contain the name, the basename
of the Info file is used.

@item --no-indent
@opindex --no-indent
Suppress formatting of new entries into the @file{dir} file.

@item --quiet
@opindex --quiet
@itemx --silent
@opindex --silent
Suppress warnings, etc., for silent operation.

@item --remove
@opindex --remove
Same as @samp{--delete}.

@item --remove-exactly
@opindex --remove-exactly
Also like @samp{--delete}, but only entries if the Info file name
matches exactly; @code{.info} and/or @code{.gz} suffixes are
@emph{not} ignored.

@item --section=@var{sec}
@opindex --section=@var{sec}
Put this file's entries in section @var{sec} of the directory.  If you
specify more than one section, all the entries are added in each of the
sections.  If you don't specify any sections, they are determined from
information in the Info file itself.  If the Info file doesn't specify
a section, the menu entries are put into the Miscellaneous section.

@item --section @var{regex} @var{sec}
@opindex --section @var{regex} @var{sec}
Same as @samp{--regex=@var{regex} --section=@var{sec} --add-once}.

@code{install-info} tries to detect when this alternate syntax is used,
but does not always guess correctly.  Here is the heuristic that
@code{install-info} uses:
@enumerate
@item
If the second argument to @code{--section} starts with a hyphen, the
original syntax is presumed.
@item
If the second argument to @code{--section} is a file that can be
opened, the original syntax is presumed.
@item
Otherwise the alternate syntax is used.
@end enumerate

When heuristic fails because your section title starts with a hyphen, or it
happens to be a filename that can be opened, the syntax should be changed
to @samp{--regex=@var{regex} --section=@var{sec} --add-once}.


@item --regex=@var{regex}
@opindex  --regex=@var{regex}
Put this file's entries into any section that matches @var{regex}.  If
more than one section matches, all of the entries are added in each of the
sections.  Specify @var{regex} using basic regular expression syntax, more
or less as used with @command{grep}, for example.

@item --test
@opindex --test
Suppress updating of the directory file.

@item --version
@opindex --version
@cindex Version number, for install-info
Display version information and exit successfully.

@chapter Generating HTML
@cindex HTML output

@command{makeinfo} generates Info output by default, but given the
@option{--html} option, it will generate HTML, for web browsers and
other programs.  This chapter gives some details on such HTML output.


@command{makeinfo} can also write in XML and Docbook format, but we do
not as yet describe these further.  @xref{Output Formats}, for a brief
overview of all the output formats.

@end menu


@node HTML Translation
@section HTML Translation

@command{makeinfo} will include segments of Texinfo source between
@code{@@ifhtml} and @code{@@end ifhtml} in the HTML output (but not
any of the other conditionals, by default).  Source between
@code{@@html} and @code{@@end html} is passed without change to the
output (i.e., suppressing the normal escaping of input @samp{<},
@samp{>} and @samp{&} characters which have special significance in
HTML).  @xref{Conditional Commands}.

@opindex --footnote-style@r{, ignored in HTML output}
The @option{--footnote-style} option is currently ignored for HTML output;
footnotes are always linked to the end of the output file.

@cindex Navigation bar, in HTML output
By default, a navigation bar is inserted at the start of each node,
analogous to Info output.  If the @samp{--no-headers} option is used,
the navigation bar is only inserted at the beginning of split files.
Header @code{<link>} elements in split output can support Info-like
navigation with browsers like Lynx and @w{Emacs W3} which implement
this HTML@tie{}1.0 feature.

@cindex HTML output, browser compatibility of
The HTML generated is standard HTML@tie{}4.  It also tries to be as
compatible as possible with earlier standards (e.g., HTML@tie{}2.0,
RFC-1866).  Some minor exceptions: 1)@tie{}HTML@tie{}3.2 tables are
generated for the @code{@@multitable} command (@pxref{Multi-column
Tables}), but they should degrade reasonably in browsers without table
support; 2)@tie{}The HTML@tie{}4 @samp{lang} attribute on the
@samp{<html>} attribute is used; 3)@tie{} Entities that are not in the
HTML@tie{}3.2 standard are also used.

It is possible to output strict HTML@tie{}3.2 output by using
@samp{--init-file=html32.init} (@pxref{Invoking texi2any}).

Please report output from an error-free run of @code{makeinfo} which
has browser portability problems as a bug (@pxref{Reporting Bugs}).


@node HTML Splitting
@section HTML Splitting
@cindex Split HTML output
@cindex HTML output, split

When splitting output at nodes (which is the default),
@command{makeinfo} writes HTML output into essentially one output file
per Texinfo source @code{@@node}.

The output file name is the node name with special characters replaced
by @samp{-}'s, so that it can work as a filename.  In the unusual case
of two different nodes having the same name after this treatment, they
are written consecutively to the same file, with HTML anchors so each
can be referred to independently.  If @command{makeinfo} is run on a
system which does not distinguish case in filenames, nodes which are
the same except for case (e.g., @samp{index} and @samp{Index}) will
also be folded into the same output file with anchors.

It is also possible to split at chapters or sections with
@option{--split} (@pxref{Invoking texi2any}).  In that case, the file
names are constructed after the name of the node associated with the
relevant sectioning command.  Also, unless @option{--no-node-files} is
specified, a redirection file is output for every node in order to
more reliably support cross-references to that manual (@pxref{HTML
Xref}).

When splitting, the HTML output files are written into a subdirectory,
with the name chosen as follows:

@enumerate
@item
@command{makeinfo} first tries the subdirectory with the base name
from @code{@@setfilename} (that is, any extension is removed).  For
example, HTML output for @code{@@setfilename gcc.info} would be
written into a subdirectory named @samp{gcc/}.

@item
If that directory cannot be created for any reason, then
@command{makeinfo} tries appending @samp{.html} to the directory name.
For example, output for @code{@@setfilename texinfo} would be written
to @samp{texinfo.html/}.

@item
If the @samp{@var{name}.html} directory can't be created either,
@code{makeinfo} gives up.

@end enumerate

@noindent In any case, the top-level output file within the directory
is always named @samp{index.html}.

Monolithic output (@code{--no-split}) is named according to
@code{@@setfilename} (with any @samp{.info} extension is replaced with
@samp{.html}), @code{--output} (the argument is used literally), or
based on the input file name as a last resort (@pxref{setfilename}).


@node HTML CSS
@section HTML CSS
@cindex HTML, and CSS
@cindex CSS, and HTML output
@cindex Cascading Style Sheets, and HTML output

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS for short) is an Internet standard for
influencing the display of HTML documents: see
@uref{http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/}.

By default, @command{makeinfo} includes a few simple CSS commands to
better implement the appearance of some of the environments.  Here
are two of them, as an example:

@example
pre.display @{ font-family:inherit @}
pre.smalldisplay @{ font-family:inherit; font-size:smaller @}
@end example

A full explanation of CSS is (far) beyond this manual; please see the
reference above.  In brief, however, this specification tells the web
browser to use a `smaller' font size for @code{@@smalldisplay} text,
and to use the `inherited' font (generally a regular roman typeface)
for both @code{@@smalldisplay} and @code{@@display}.  By default, the
HTML @samp{<pre>} command uses a monospaced font.

You can influence the CSS in the HTML output with two
@command{makeinfo} options: @option{--css-include=@var{file}} and
@option{--css-ref=@var{url}}.

The option @option{--css-ref=@var{url}} adds to each output HTML file
a @samp{<link>} tag referencing a CSS at the given @var{url}. This
allows using external style sheets.

The option @option{--css-include=@var{file}} includes the contents
@var{file} in the HTML output, as you might expect.  However, the
details are somewhat tricky, as described in the following, to provide
maximum flexibility.

@cindex @@import specifications, in CSS files
The CSS file may begin with so-called @samp{@@import} directives,
which link to external CSS specifications for browsers to use when
interpreting the document.  Again, a full description is beyond our
scope here, but we'll describe how they work syntactically, so we can
explain how @command{makeinfo} handles them.

@cindex Comments, in CSS files
There can be more than one @samp{@@import}, but they have to come
first in the file, with only whitespace and comments interspersed, no
normal definitions.  (Technical exception: an @samp{@@charset}
directive may precede the @samp{@@import}'s.  This does not alter
@command{makeinfo}'s behavior, it just copies the @samp{@@charset} if
present.)  Comments in CSS files are delimited by @samp{/* ... */}, as
in C.  An @samp{@@import} directive must be in one of these two forms:

@example
@@import url(http://example.org/foo.css);
@@import "http://example.net/bar.css";
@end example

As far as @command{makeinfo} is concerned, the crucial characters are
the @samp{@@} at the beginning and the semicolon terminating the
directive.  When reading the CSS file, it simply copies any such
@samp{@@}-directive into the output, as follows:

@itemize
@item If @var{file} contains only normal CSS declarations, it is
included after @command{makeinfo}'s default CSS, thus overriding it.

@item If @var{file} begins with @samp{@@import} specifications (see
below), then the @samp{import}'s are included first (they have to come
first, according to the standard), and then @command{makeinfo}'s
default CSS is included.  If you need to override @command{makeinfo}'s
defaults from an @samp{@@import}, you can do so with the @samp{!@:
important} CSS construct, as in:
@example
pre.smallexample @{ font-size: inherit ! important @}
@end example

@item If @var{file} contains both @samp{@@import} and inline CSS
specifications, the @samp{@@import}'s are included first, then
@command{makeinfo}'s defaults, and lastly the inline CSS from
@var{file}.

@item Any @@-directive other than @samp{@@import} and @samp{@@charset}
is treated as a CSS declaration, meaning @command{makeinfo} includes
its default CSS and then the rest of the file.
@end itemize

If the CSS file is malformed or erroneous, @command{makeinfo}'s output
is unspecified.  @command{makeinfo} does not try to interpret the
meaning of the CSS file in any way; it just looks for the special
@samp{@@} and @samp{;} characters and blindly copies the text into the
output.  Comments in the CSS file may or may not be included in the
output.


@node HTML Xref
@section HTML Cross-references
@cindex HTML cross-references
@cindex Cross-references, in HTML output

Cross-references between Texinfo manuals in HTML format amount, in the
end, to a standard HTML @code{<a>} link, but the details are
unfortunately complex.  This section describes the algorithm used in
detail, so that Texinfo can cooperate with other programs, such as
@command{texi2html}, by writing mutually compatible HTML files.

This algorithm may or may not be used for links @emph{within} HTML
output for a Texinfo file.  Since no issues of compatibility arise in
such cases, we do not need to specify this.

We try to support references to such ``external'' manuals in both
monolithic and split forms.  A @dfn{monolithic} (mono) manual is
entirely contained in one file, and a @dfn{split} manual has a file
for each node.  (@xref{HTML Splitting}.)

@node HTML Xref Link Basics
@subsection HTML Cross-reference Link Basics
@cindex HTML cross-reference link basics

For our purposes, an HTML link consists of four components: a host
name, a directory part, a file part, and a target part.  We
always assume the @code{http} protocol.  For example:

@example
http://@var{host}/@var{dir}/@var{file}.html#@var{target}
@end example

The information to construct a link comes from the node name and
manual name in the cross-reference command in the Texinfo source
(@pxref{Cross References}), and from @dfn{external information}, which
is currently simply hardwired.  In the future, it may come from an
external data file.

We now consider each part in turn.

The @var{host} is hardwired to be the local host.  This could either
be the literal string @samp{localhost}, or, according to the rules for
HTML links, the @samp{http://localhost/} could be omitted entirely.

The @var{dir} and @var{file} parts are more complicated, and depend on
the relative split/mono nature of both the manual being processed and
the manual that the cross-reference refers to.  The underlying idea is
that there is one directory for Texinfo manuals in HTML, and a given
@var{manual} is either available as a monolithic file
@file{@var{manual}.html}, or a split subdirectory
@file{@var{manual}/*.html}.  Here are the cases:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If the present manual is split, and the referent manual is also split,
the directory is @samp{../@var{referent/}} and the file is the
expanded node name (described later).

@item
If the present manual is split, and the referent manual is mono, the
directory is @samp{../} and the file is @file{@var{referent}.html}.

@item
If the present manual is mono, and the referent manual is split, the
directory is @file{@var{referent}/} and the file is the expanded node
name.

@item
If the present manual is mono, and the referent manual is also mono,
the directory is @file{./} (or just the empty string), and the file is
@file{@var{referent}.html}.

@end itemize

One exception: the algorithm for node name expansion prefixes the
string @samp{g_t} when the node name begins with a non-letter.  This
kludge (due to XHTML rules) is not necessary for filenames, and is
therefore omitted.

Any directory part in the filename argument of the source
cross-reference command is ignored.  Thus, @code{@@xref@{,,,../foo@}}
and @code{@@xref@{,,,foo@}} both use @samp{foo} as the manual name.
This is because any such attempted hardwiring of the directory is very
unlikely to be useful for both Info and HTML output.

Finally, the @var{target} part is always the expanded node name.

Whether the present manual is split or mono is determined by user
option; @command{makeinfo} defaults to split, with the
@option{--no-split} option overriding this.

Whether the referent manual is split or mono is another bit of the
external information.  For now, @command{makeinfo} simply assumes the
referent manual is the same as the present manual.

There can be a mismatch between the format of the referent manual that
the generating software assumes, and the format it's actually present
in.  @xref{HTML Xref Mismatch}.


@node HTML Xref Node Name Expansion
@subsection HTML Cross-reference Node Name Expansion
@cindex HTML cross-reference node name expansion
@cindex node name expansion, in HTML cross-references
@cindex expansion, of node names in HTML cross-references

As mentioned in the previous section, the key part of the HTML
cross-reference algorithm is the conversion of node names in the
Texinfo source into strings suitable for XHTML identifiers and
filenames.  The restrictions are similar for each: plain ASCII
letters, numbers, and the @samp{-} and @samp{_} characters are all
that can be used.  (Although HTML anchors can contain most characters,
XHTML is more restrictive.)

Cross-references in Texinfo can actually refer either to nodes or
anchors (@pxref{anchor}), but anchors are treated identically to nodes
in this context, so we'll continue to say ``node'' names for
simplicity.

(@@-commands and 8-bit characters are not presently handled by
@command{makeinfo} for HTML cross-references.  See the next section.)

A special exception: the Top node (@pxref{The Top Node}) is always
mapped to the file @file{index.html}, to match web server software.
However, the HTML @emph{target} is @samp{Top}.  Thus (in the split case):

@example
@@xref@{Top, Introduction,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual@}.
@result{} <a href="emacs/index.html#Top">
@end example

@enumerate
@item
The standard ASCII letters (a-z and A-Z) are not modified.  All other
characters are changed as specified below.

@item
The standard ASCII numbers (0-9) are not modified except when a number
is the first character of the node name.  In that case, see below.

@item
Multiple consecutive space, tab and newline characters are transformed
into just one space.  (It's not possible to have newlines in node
names with the current implementation, but we specify it anyway, just
in case.)

@item
Leading and trailing spaces are removed.

@item
After the above has been applied, each remaining space character is
converted into a @samp{-} character.

@item
Other ASCII 7-bit characters are transformed into @samp{_00@var{xx}},
where @var{xx} is the ASCII character code in (lowercase) hexadecimal.
This includes @samp{_}, which is mapped to @samp{_005f}.

@item
If the node name does not begin with a letter, the literal string
@samp{g_t} is prefixed to the result.  (Due to the rules above, that
string can never occur otherwise; it is an arbitrary choice, standing
for ``GNU Texinfo''.)  This is necessary because XHTML requires that
identifiers begin with a letter.

@end enumerate

For example:

@example
@@node A  node --- with _'%
@result{} A-node-_002d_002d_002d-with-_005f_0027_0025
@end example

Notice in particular:

@itemize @bullet
@item @samp{_} @result{} @samp{_005f}
@item @samp{-} @result{} @samp{_002d}
@item @samp{A  node} @result{} @samp{A-node}
@end itemize

On case-folding computer systems, nodes differing only by case will be
mapped to the same file.

In particular, as mentioned above, Top always maps to the file
@file{index.html}.  Thus, on a case-folding system, Top and a node
named `Index' will both be written to @file{index.html}.

Fortunately, the targets serve to distinguish these cases, since HTML
target names are always case-sensitive, independent of operating
system.


@node HTML Xref Command Expansion
@subsection HTML Cross-reference Command Expansion
@cindex HTML cross-reference command expansion

In standard Texinfo, node names may not contain @@-commands. xxx
@command{makeinfo} supports @@-commands in node names, but @TeX{}
might not. Therefore, even if @command{makeinfo} implements this part
of the HTML cross-reference algorithm, you should still avoid using
@@-commands in node names.

First, comments are removed.

Next, any @code{@@value} commands (@pxref{set value}) and macro invocations
(@pxref{Invoking Macros}) are fully expanded.

Then, for the following commands, the command name and braces are removed,
the text of the argument is recursively transformed:
@example
@@asis @@b @@cite @@code @@command @@dfn @@dmn @@dotless
@@emph @@env @@file @@i @@indicateurl @@kbd @@key
@@samp @@sansserif @@sc @@slanted @@strong @@t @@var @@w
@end example

@noindent For @code{@@sc}, any letters are capitalized.

The following commands are replaced by constant text, as shown.  If
any of these commands have non-empty arguments, as in
@code{@@TeX@{bad@}}, it is an error, and the result is unspecified.
`(space)' means a space character, `(nothing)' means the empty string,
etc.  The notation `U+@var{xxxx}' means Unicode code point @var{xxxx}
(in hex, as usual).  There are further transformations of many of
these expansions for the final file or target name, such as space
characters to @samp{-}, etc., according to the other rules.

@node HTML Xref 8-bit Character Expansion
@subsection HTML Cross-reference 8-bit Character Expansion
@cindex HTML cross-reference 8-bit character expansion
@cindex 8-bit characters, in HTML cross-references
@cindex Expansion of 8-bit characters in HTML cross-references
@cindex Transliteration of 8-bit characters in HTML cross-references

Usually, characters other than plain 7-bit ASCII are transformed into
the corresponding Unicode code point(s) in Normalization Form C, which
uses precomposed characters where available.  (This is the
normalization form recommended by the W3C and other bodies.)  This
holds when that code point is 0xffff or less, as it almost always is.

These will then be further transformed by the rules above into the
string @samp{_@var{xxxx}}, where @var{xxxx} is the code point in hex.

For example, combining this rule and the previous section:

@example
@@node @@b@{A@} @@TeX@{@} @@u@{B@} @@point@{@}@@enddots@{@}
@result{} A-TeX-B_0306-_2605_002e_002e_002e
@end example

Notice: 1)@tie{}@code{@@enddots} expands to three periods which in
turn expands to three @samp{_002e}'s; 2)@tie{}@code{@@u@{B@}} is a `B'
with a breve accent, which does not exist as a pre-accented Unicode
character, therefore expands to @samp{B_0306} (B with combining
breve).

When the Unicode code point is above 0xffff, the transformation is
@samp{__@var{xxxxxx}}, that is, two leading underscores followed by
six hex digits.  Since Unicode has declared that their highest code
point is 0x10ffff, this is sufficient.  (We felt it was better to
define this extra escape than to always use six hex digits, since the
first two would nearly always be zeros.)

This method works fine if the node name consists mostly of ASCII
characters and contains only few 8-bit ones. If the document is
written in a language whose script is not based on the Latin alphabet
(such as, e.g. Ukrainian), it will create file names consisting
entirely of @samp{_@var{xxxx}} notations, which is inconvenient.

To handle such cases, @command{makeinfo} offers
@option{--transliterate-file-names} command line option. This option
enables @dfn{transliteration} of node names into ASCII characters for
the purposes of file name creation and referencing. The
transliteration is based on phonetic principle, which makes the
produced file names easily readable.

For the definition of Unicode Normalization Form C, see Unicode report
UAX#15, @uref{http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/}.  Many related
documents and implementations are available elsewhere on the web.


@node HTML Xref Mismatch
@subsection HTML Cross-reference Mismatch
@cindex HTML cross-reference mismatch
@cindex Mismatched HTML cross-reference source and target

As mentioned earlier (@pxref{HTML Xref Link Basics}), the generating
software has to guess whether a given manual being cross-referenced is
available in split or monolithic form---and, inevitably, it might
guess wrong.  However, when the referent manual is generated, it is
possible to handle at least some mismatches.

In the case where we assume the referent is split, but it is actually
available in mono, the only recourse would be to generate a
@file{manual/} subdirectory full of HTML files which redirect back to
the monolithic @file{manual.html}.  Since this is essentially the same
as a split manual in the first place, it's not very appealing.

On the other hand, in the case where we assume the referent is mono,
but it is actually available in split, it is possible to use
JavaScript to redirect from the putatively monolithic
@file{manual.html} to the different @file{manual/node.html} files.
Here's an example:

@example
function redirect() @{
  switch (location.hash) @{
    case "#Node1":
      location.replace("manual/Node1.html#Node1"); break;
    case "#Node2" :
      location.replace("manual/Node2.html#Node2"); break;
    @dots{}
    default:;
  @}
@}
@end example

Then, in the @code{<body>} tag of @file{manual.html}:

@example
<body onLoad="redirect();">
@end example

Once again, this is something the software which generated the
@emph{referent} manual has to do in advance, it's not something the
software generating the cross-reference in the present manual can
control.


@node HTML Xref Configuration
@subsection HTML Cross-reference Configuration: @file{htmlxref.cnf}

@pindex htmlxref.cnf
@cindex HTML cross-reference configuration
@cindex Cross-reference configuration, for HTML
@cindex Configuration, for HTML cross-manual references

@command{makeinfo} reads a file named @file{htmlxref.cnf} to gather
information for cross-references to other manuals in HTML output.  It
is looked for in the following directories:

@table @file
@item @var{srcdir}/.texinfo/
(where @var{srcdir} is the directory with the Texinfo input file)

@item ~/.texinfo/
(where @code{~} is the current user's home directory)

@item @var{sysconfdir}/texinfo/
(where @var{sysconfdir} is the system configuration directory
specified at compile-time, e.g., @file{/usr/local/etc})

@item @var{datadir}/texinfo/
(likewise specified at compile time, e.g., @file{/usr/local/share})
@end table

The first file found is used.  The Texinfo distribution includes a
default file which handles many GNU manuals; it is installed in the
last of the above directories, i.e.,
@file{@var{datadir}/texinfo/htmlxref.cnf}.

The file is line-oriented.  Lines consisting only of whitespace are
ignored.  Comments are indicated with a @samp{#} at the beginning of a
line, optionally preceded by whitespace.  Since @samp{#} can occur in
url's (like almost any character), it does not otherwise start a
comment.

Each non-blank non-comment line must be either a @dfn{variable
assignment} or @dfn{manual information}.

A variable assignment line looks like this:

@example
@var{varname} = @var{varvalue}
@end example

Whitespace around the @samp{=} is optional and ignored.  The
@var{varname} should consist of letters; case is significant.  The
@var{varvalue} is an arbitrary string, continuing to the end of the
line.  Variables are then referenced with @samp{$@{@var{varname}@}};
variable references can occur in the @var{varvalue}.

A manual information line looks like this:

@example
@var{manual} @var{keyword} @var{urlprefix}
@end example

@noindent
with @var{manual} the short identifier for a manual, @var{keyword}
being one of: @code{mono}, @code{node}, @code{section},
@code{chapter}, and @var{urlprefix} described below.  Variable
references can occur only in the @var{urlprefix}.  For example (used
in the canonical @file{htmlxref.cnf}):

@smallexample
R = http://www.gnu.org
RS = $@{R@}/software
hello mono    $@{RS@}/hello/manual/hello.html
hello node    $@{RS@}/hello/manual/html_node/
hello section $@{RS@}/hello/manual/html_section/
hello chapter $@{RS@}/hello/manual/html_chapter/
@end smallexample

@cindex monolithic manuals, for HTML cross-references
If the keyword is @code{mono}, @var{urlprefix} gives the host,
directory, and file name for @var{manual} as one monolithic file.

@cindex split manuals, for HTML cross-references
If the keyword is @code{node}, @code{section}, or @code{chapter},
@var{urlprefix} gives the host and directory for @var{manual} split
into nodes, sections, or chapters, respectively.

When available, @command{makeinfo} will use the ``corresponding''
value for cross-references between manuals.  That is, when generating
monolithic output (@option{--no-split}), the @code{mono} url will be
used, when generating output that is split by node, the @code{node}
url will be used, etc.  However, if a manual is not available in that
form, whatever is available will be used.  Here is the search order
for each style that can be generated:

@smallexample
node    @result{} node,    section, chapter, mono
section @result{} section, chapter, node,    mono
chapter @result{} chapter, section, node,    mono
mono    @result{} mono,    chapter, section, split
@end smallexample

@opindex --node-files@r{, and HTML cross-references}
These section- and chapter-level cross-manual references can succeed
only when the target manual was created using @option{--node-files},
which is the default for split output.

If you have additions or corrections to the @file{htmlxref.cnf}
distributed with Texinfo, please email @email{bug-texinfo@@gnu.org}.

@node HTML Xref Link Preservation
@subsection HTML Cross-reference Link Preservation: @var{manual}@file{-noderename.cnf}

@cindex HTML cross-reference link preservation
@cindex Preserving HTML links to old nodes
@cindex Old nodes, preserving links to
@cindex Renaming nodes, and preserving links
@cindex Links, preserving to renamed nodes

Occasionally changes in a program require removing (or renaming) nodes
in the manual in order to have the best documentation.  Given the
nature of the web, however, links may exist anywhere to any such
removed node (renaming appears the same as removal for this purpose),
and it's not ideal for those links to simply break.

Therefore, Texinfo provides a way for manual authors to specify old
node names and the new nodes to which the old names should be
redirected, via the file @var{manual}@file{-noderename.cnf}, where
@var{manual} is the base name of the manual.  For example, the manual
@file{texinfo.txi} would be supplemented by a file
@file{texinfo-noderename}.cnf.  (This name can be overridden by
setting the @file{RENAMED_NODES_FILE} configuration variable;
@pxref{makeinfo Configuration Variables}).

The file is read in pairs of lines, as follows:

@example
@var{old-node-name}
@@@@@{@} @var{new-node-name}
@end example

The usual conversion from Texinfo node names to HTML names is applied;
see this entire section for details (@pxref{HTML Xref}).  The unusual
@samp{@@@@@{@}} separator is used because it is not a valid Texinfo
construct, so can't appear in the node names.

The effect is that @command{makeinfo} generates a redirect from
@var{old-node-name} to @var{new-node-name} when producing HTML output.
Thus, external links to the old node will not simply break.

Lines consisting only of whitespace are ignored.  Comments are
indicated with a @samp{@@c} at the beginning of a line, optionally
preceded by whitespace.

@node Loading initialization files
@section Loading initialization files and search paths

It is possible to load initialization files to modify almost every
aspect of output formatting.  The program loads initialization files
named @file{Config} each time it is run.  Those files are looked for
in the following directories (where @var{prog} is the name of the 
program invoked on the command line, normally @code{makeinfo} 
or @code{texi2any}):

@table @file
@item ./
(the current directory)

@item ~/.@var{prog}/
(where @code{~} is the current user's home directory)

@item @var{sysconfdir}/@var{prog}/
(where @var{sysconfdir} is the system configuration directory
specified at compile-time, e.g., @file{/usr/local/etc})

@item @var{datadir}/@var{prog}/
(likewise specified at compile time, e.g., @file{/usr/local/share})
@end table

All the files found are used, in that order. 

The most common way to load initialization files is to use the 
@option{--init-file} option to specify the file to be loaded.  The 
initialization files are looked for
in for in the same directories than @file{Config} files, and also
in additional directories (the same that are used 
for @ref{HTML Xref Configuration} in the @file{init/} subdirectory).  
By default the following directories are searched, in this
order (where @var{prog} is the name of the program invoked on the
command line) the first file found is used:

@enumerate
@item The current directory @file{.};

@item @file{$HOME/.@var{prog}}, where @env{$HOME} is the user home directory;

@item @file{@var{sysconfdir}/@var{prog}}, where @var{sysconfdir} is
the system directory for host-specific configuration, determined at
build time (@code{/usr/local/etc} by default);

@item @file{@var{datadir}/@var{prog}} where @var{datadir} is the
system directory for data files, determined at build time
(@code{/usr/local/share} by default);

@item the directory @file{.texinfo/init} in the current directory;

@item @file{$HOME/.texinfo/init} where @env{$HOME} is the user home directory;

@item @file{@var{sysconfdir}/texinfo/init} with @var{sysconfdir} as above;

@item @file{@var{datadir}/texinfo/init} with @var{datadir} as above.

@end enumerate

Additional directories may be appended with @option{--conf-dir}.


@node Initialization files basics
@section General informations on initialization files

Initialization files are @command{perl} files, read as explained
in @ref{Loading initialization files}. 
A good source of inspiration could be the initialization files provided
in the Texinfo distribution.  They all have @samp{.init} extension.
The @file{texi2html.init} file is used to set all the defaults, and,
although quite large is an interesting source of examples.
Simpler initialization files are installed in the default case, they may
also be interesting starting points.

In initialization file three kind of variables appear.
@table @asis
@item configuration variables
Those variables, described in @ref{makeinfo Configuration Variables}
are set and accessed through specific functions in initialization files.
@item scalar, arrays and hashes
Normal perl variable. The order of loading of initialization
files and of command-line options processing may be important when 
they are modified,
later changes modifying former changes.
@item references on functions
This allows a dynamical redefinition of functions used to produce
the output.

As the functions are defined by a reference name, we will always
use the reference name in function prototypes.  For the function arguments
we will use @code{\@@array} for a reference on an array and similarly
@code{\%hash} for a reference on a hash.

Thus, the prototype for the function associated with the function
reference @samp{$formatting_function} will be:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $text formatting_function $arg1 \@@arg2
@code{formatting_function} takes as first argument @var{$arg2},
as second argument a reference on an array @var{\@@arg2}
and returns the formatted text @var{$text}.
@end deftypefn

To redefined the corresponding function, you should write:

@example
$formatting_function = \&my_formatting_function;

sub my_formatting_function($ $)
@{
    my $arg1 = shift;
    my $arg2 = shift;
    # prepare $formatted_text
    .....
    return $formatted_text;
@}
@end example
@end table

Initialization file are loaded from the main program by
the mean of a @code{require}, while in the @code{Texi2HTML::Config}
namespace. This means that the namespace of the main program and
the namespace of initialization files are distinct, which ensures
that no name clash should happen.  The scalars,
arrays and hashes are declared with
@code{use vars}, such that it should be possible to use the
@code{use strict} pragma in the initialization file code.

To avoid messing with the variables in the @code{main} namespace
all the global variables which could be of use in the init files
are in the @code{Texi2HTML} namespace.  Notice that the functions
of the main program are still in the @code{main} namespace.

Since the program can proceed more than one file on the
command line, you should make sure that you initialize the variables
that are used during a manual formatting.  It is possible to call
functions at different stages for that 
use (@pxref{Calling functions at different stages}).

@node Setting and getting configuration variable value
@subsection Setting and getting configuration variable value

To set the value of a configuration variable from an initialization file,
you should use the function:
@defun set_from_init_file ($variable_name, $variable_value)
@var{$variable_name} is a string containing the name of the variable 
you want to set, and @var{$variable_value} is the value you want to set.
@var{$variable_value} may be @samp{undef}.  For example
@example
set_from_init_file('documentlanguage', 'fr');
@end example
should override the @code{@@documentlanguage} from the document.
It will be overriden by @option{--document-language} on the 
command-line.

Another example, 
@example
set_from_init_file('SPLIT', 'chapter');
@end example
should override the default splitting of the document.  It will be
overriden by the @option{--split} option on the command-line.

And, as a last example, 
@example
set_from_init_file('NO_CSS', 1);
@end example
wil override the default value for @code{NO_CSS}.  It will be overriden by
@code{--set-init-variable NO_CSS=1} on the command-line.
@end defun

To get the value of a variable, the function is @code{get_conf},
in the @code{Texi2HTML::Config} namespace:
@defun get_conf ($variable_name)
@var{$variable_name} is  the name of the variable you want to know the 
value.
@end defun

For example:

@example
if (get_conf('footnotestyle') eq 'separate') @{ .... @}
@end example

The list of configuration variables associated with @@-commands is
in @ref{Configuration variables for @@-commands}, the list and mapping
of configuration variables associated with command line options is at 
@ref{Configuration variables and options}.

@subsection Getting the values of flags set by @code{@@set}

Flags defined by @code{@@set} may be accessed through the 
@code{%main::value} hash.  The key is the flag name, the value is the
flag value. 


@node Encodings
@subsection Setting the encodings

There are four relevant encodings variables, they are autodetected
if not set:
@table @code
@item documentencoding
This configuration variable may be set, if not defined, the encoding 
appearing in @code{@@documentencoding} will be used.
@item IN_ENCODING
The texinfo files encoding, may also be set.
Otherwise, when @code{documentencoding}
is set, @code{IN_ENCODING} is also set
if the encoding is supported by perl.
@item OUT_ENCODING
The out files encoding.  If not set, the value of
@code{ENCODING_NAME} 
or 
@code{IN_ENCODING}
is used if one of these variables is set.
@item ENCODING_NAME
The encoding advertized in out files.
If unset the value of this variable is based on the
other ENCODING values, and if they are all undefined, the variable
@code{DEFAULT_ENCODING} is used. 
@end table

The values for the encoding related variables are set in the default 
@code{init_out} function reference (@pxref{Output initialization}).

In general the @code{documentencoding} and @code{IN_ENCODING} are
set to the right values. @code{OUT_ENCODING} is also rightly set
according to @code{ENCODING_NAME}. 
To force a given encoding for the output, the
@code{ENCODING_NAME} value may be set.  The current default output encoding
is UTF-8. 


@node Redefining functions
@subsection Redefining functions in initialization files

To redefine a function you must replace the corresponding funtion
reference with a reference on your function. 
Thus you should write your function, give it a name you
are certain it is unique in the @code{Texi2HTML::Config} namespace,
and override the value of the function reference with your own 
function reference.  When another function from the main program
(or from another functions of a initialization file) calls the reference,
your function will be used. 

For example the function
reference corresponding with the function called when doing an
anchor is called @code{$anchor}.  Thus if you want to override the
corresponding function
you could write:

@example
# override the function reference
$anchor = \&my_own_function;

# the function reference now refers to
sub my_own_function @{
# process arguments and return an html anchor
@}
@end example


@node Three passes
@subsection Three passes: macro expansion, document structure and output

There are three passes for @command{texi2any}. During 
pass 0, the @code{@@macro} are 
expanded, in pass 1 the document structure is gathered and in pass 2
the result is output. In most cases you shouldn't care about
it, as almost all of the output customization is done in pass 2.
Only if you want to do something before the pass 2 should you care,
see just below.

@node Initializing and finalizing
@subsection Preparing and finalizing the output

@anchor{Output initialization}
@cindex Preparing the output

After the texinfo file has been parsed, some information is available
which can be used to modify some variables and prepare the outputting.
For example the document language, the document encoding, 
values set with @code{@@set} or @code{@@setfilename} and other similar 
@@-commands are not known before the texinfo parsing. 

The following function reference may be redefined to be called after 
texinfo processing and before document generation:

@deffn {Function Reference} init_out
This function perform the initialization of variables and any other
task before document outputting. 
@end deffn

In the default case, the hashes 
@code{%BUTTONS_NAME}  (@pxref{Button specifications}),   
@code{%BUTTONS_GOTO} (@pxref{About text}) are initialized.
Indeed the initialization of these variables is dependent upon 
the document language selection.  Similarly the encoding variables are set
based on the information now available (@pxref{Encodings}).
When generating HTML, aditionally, the @code{%NAVIGATION_TEXT}
hash is initialized.

To perform the default initializations and also add more code, you could
do as in the following example (save the default function reference and call 
it in your own function):

@example
my $default_init_out = $init_out;
$init_out = \&makeinfo_like_init_out;
sub makeinfo_like_init_out() 
@{
   &$default_init_out();
   $NAVIGATION_TEXT@{'Following'@} = ' &gt; ';
@}
@end example

@anchor{Output finalization}
@cindex Finalizing the output

If you want to do some cleaning after the document was generated (close
files, write at the end of files and so on), the following function 
reference may be redefined:

@deffn {Function Reference} finish_out
This function is called after the document generation.
@end deffn

The default is to do nothing.

These function references are mostly redundant with the handlers described 
in @ref{Calling functions at different stages}.

@node Calling functions at different stages
@subsection Calling functions at different stages

Arbitrary user defined functions may be called between the 
different Texinfo parsing and outputting passes.  This could be used, for
example, to initialize variables before collecting the @@-commands and their
text, expanding them between the collecting and expansion phase and doing
some cleaning after the expansion pass. 

There are five places for user defined functions, associated with arrays.
The function references in these arrays are called one after another.
The arrays correspond with the different stages:
@vtable @code
@item @@command_handler_setup
The function references in that array are called before anything is done, 
including collecting the output file names.  The input file names directory
are available.
@item @@command_handler_init
The function references in that array are called as soon as the file names are 
known. It may be at different moments, before processing anything, right after
@@sefilename, or at the end of the first pass (after @@macro and @@include
expansions).
At that time the information available is essentially the file names.
@item @@command_handler_names
The function references in that array are called right after the collecting
pass.  At that time all the special @@-commands  
have been collected as explained above but no output has been produced,
the element (node and section) names hasn't been processed and expanded.
@item @@command_handler_process
The function references in that array are called after the element names 
have been processed, but before the main output initialization.
@item @@command_handler_output
The function references in that array are called rigth before the 
main output processing, so that more informations are available,
like the title.
@item @@command_handler_finish
he function references in that array are called after the end of the
output generation.
@end vtable 

Here is an example of these arrays use:

@example
push @@command_handler_init, \&Texi2HTML::LaTeX2HTML::init;
push @@command_handler_process, \&Texi2HTML::LaTeX2HTML::latex2html;
push @@command_handler_finish, \&Texi2HTML::LaTeX2HTML::finish;
@end example

@node External formatting of commands
@subsection External formatting of commands

It is possible to bypass completely the normal formatting of @@-commands 
with braces and the block commands holding raw input
(@code{@@html}, @code{@@tex}, @code{@@xml}@dots{} regions). 
In that case the @@-commands and the text within 
are passed to a user defined function early, right after the document structure determination, in pass 1 (@pxref{Three passes}).
Another user defined function is called during the output expansion phase.

@vindex %command_handler
The @@-commands that are keys of the @code{%command_handler} hash 
are collected when determining the document structure 
pass and expanded in the expansion
pass using user defined functions. The associated value is a reference on
a hash used to specify the user defined function references. 
The key of the hash reference are @code{'init'} for the function
reference called during the first pass, and @code{'expand'}
during the expansion pass. Here is an example for an @@-command with
braces, @code{math}, used for an expansion using @LaTeX{}toHTML:

@example
$command_handler@{'math'@} =
     @{ 'init' => \&Texi2HTML::LaTeX2HTML::to_latex,
       'expand' => \&Texi2HTML::LaTeX2HTML::do_tex
     @};
@end example


And an example for a raw region @@-command:

@example
$command_handler@{'tex'@} =
     @{ 'init' => \&Texi2HTML::LaTeX2HTML::to_latex,
       'expand' => \&Texi2HTML::LaTeX2HTML::do_tex
     @};
@end example

The function references are called like:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $status $command_handler@{'$command'@}->@{'init'@} $command $text $count
@var{$command} is the @@-command name, @var{$text} is the text appearing 
within the @@-command. @var{$count} is a counter counting how many times
this @@-command appeared. @var{$status} is a boolean which should be true if 
the collecting was succesfull. If false the @@-command and the text is 
discarded.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $result $command_handler@{'$command'@}->@{'expand'@} $command $count $state $text
@var{$command} is the @@-command name, @var{$count} is a counter counting 
how many times this @@-command appeared. @var{$state} is a reference on a 
hash containing many informations about the context. @var{$text} should be
empty. @var{$result} is the expanded resulting text.
@end deftypefn

@node Program string customization
@subsection Program string customization

There is a function reference that may be used to construct a string 
advertizing the program used to generate the manual. It may 
be used in the About element, and in the footers if
@code{PROGRAM_NAME_IN_FOOTER} is set.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $program_string_formatted program_string
This function reference should return the formatted program
string.
@end deftypefn

@node Customizing generalized block command opening
@subsection Customizing generalized block command opening

A  generalized block
 @@-command is any @@-command that ends with a @code{@@end} except 
@@-commands that only select if the input is processed (like 
@code{@@ignore} or @code{@@ifhtml}) or raw @@-commands (like @code{@@verbatim}
and @code{@@html}).

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $line begin_format_texi $command $line \%state
The @var{$command} is the format command, the @var{$line} is the 
line following the @@-command, @var{\%state} is a reference on
a hash containing many formatting information.  It can modify the 
line and return something else.

In the default case, it is used to keep track of the multitable nesting.
As a consequence, it is linked with the multitable formating. 
@xref{Multitable formatting}.
@end deftypefn

@node Four contexts
@subsection Four contexts for expansions: preformatted, normal, string and math

There are four contexts of interest:
@table @emph 
@item normal context
In paragraphs, index entries, tables...
@item preformatted context
The preformatted
context occurs when the spacing between words is kept. This is the
case, for example, in @code{@@display} or @code{@@example} regions, and in 
menu comments (@pxref{Menu formatting}). 
The preformatted regions are usually
rendered in @code{<pre>} elements in @acronym{HTML}.
@item string context
The string context occurs when rendering strings without formatting elements,
in comments or titles for example. There are in fact two string contexts,
one that produces plain text, the other allow for limited formatting,
typically without any element when producing HTML or XML.
@item math context
Currently in @code{@@math}.
@end table


@node Internationalization of Strings
@subsection Internationalization of Strings in the Output Document

@cindex I18n
@cindex Internationalization of strings in the output document
@cindex Output documentation, internationalization of

@vindex documentlanguage @r{configuration variable}
@command{texi2any} writes some fixed strings in the generated document
at various places: for cross-references, in page footers, on the help
page, alternate text for images, and so on.  The string chosen depends
on the value of the configuration variable @code{documentlanguage} at
the time of the string output (@pxref{documentlanguage}, for the
Texinfo command interface).

@pindex libintl-perl Gettext implementation
The Gettext framework is used for those strings (@pxref{Top,,,
gettext, Gettext}).  The @code{libintl-perl} package is used as
the @code{gettext} implementation; more specifically, the pure Perl
implementation is used, so Texinfo can support consistent behavior
across all platforms and installations, which would not otherwise be
possible.  @code{libintl-perl} is included in the Texinfo distribution
and always installed, to be sure that it is available if needed.  It
is also possible to use the system @code{gettext}; currently decided
at build-time).  

@vindex texinfo_document Gettext domain
The Gettext domain @samp{texinfo_document} is used for the strings,
and the subroutine @code{gdt} is used for translated
strings:

@defun gdt ($string, \%variables_hash, \%state)
with @var{$string} the string to be translated, @var{\%variables_hash}
a reference to a hash holding the variable parts of the translated
string, and @var{\%state} a hash reference determining the context of
expansion (e.g., use the document state, expansion in string, no
expansion, @dots{}).
@end defun

@cindex Perl format strings for translation
Translated strings are written as Texinfo, and may include
@@-commands.  In translated strings, the varying parts of the string
are not usually denoted by @code{%s} and the like, but by
@samp{@{arg_name@}}.  (This convention is common for @code{gettext} in
Perl and is fully supported in GNU Gettext; @pxref{perl-format,, Perl
Format Strings, gettext, GNU Gettext}.)  For example, in the
following, @samp{@{section@}} will be replaced by the section name:

@example
see @{section@}
@end example

These Perl-style brace format strings are used for two reasons: first,
changing the order of @code{printf} arguments is only available since
Perl@tie{}5.8.0; second, and more importantly, the order of the
argument is unpredictable, since @@-command expansion may lead to
different orders depending on the output format.  The expansion of
a translation string is done like this:

@enumerate
@item First, the string is translated.  The locale 
is @@documentlanguage.@@documentencoding.

@cindex @code{us-ascii} encoding, and translations
If the @@documentlanguage is like @var{ll_CC}, @var{ll_CC} is tried
first, and then @var{ll}.  If that does not exist, and the encoding is
not @code{us-ascii}, then @code{us-ascii} is tried.  The idea is that
if there is a @code{us-ascii} encoding, it means that all the
characters in the charset may be expressed as @@-commands.  For
example, there is a @code{fr.us-ascii} locale that can accomodate any
encoding, since all the Latin@tie{}1 characters have associated
@@-commands.  On the other hand, Japanese has only a translation
@code{ja.utf-8}, since there are no @@-commands for Japanese characters.

@item Next, the args in string are protected, for example
@samp{@{arg_name@}} becomes
@samp{@@internal_translation_open_brace@{@}arg_name@@internal_translation_close_brace@{@}}
(this part is skipped if there is nothing to expand).

@item Next, the string is expanded as a Texinfo string.
@samp{@@internal_translation_open_brace@{@}} expands to @{ and
@samp{@@internal_translation_close_brace@{@}} expands to @}, such 
that in the end one still gets @samp{@{arg_name@}} within an expanded 
string (this part is skipped if there is nothing to expand).

@item Then the arguments are substituted; for 
Example, @samp{@{arg_name@}} is replace by the corresponding actual
argument.

@end enumerate

In the following example, @samp{@{date@}}, @samp{@{program_homepage@}}
and @samp{@{program@}} are the arguments of the string.  Since they
are used in @code{@@uref}, their order is not predictable.  The
@samp{@{'duplicate'=>1@}} means that the document state should be used
when expanding the string.  @samp{@{date@}},
@samp{@{program_homepage@}} and @samp{@{program@}} are substituted
after the expansion, which means that they should already be
acceptable output:

@example
gdt('Generated on @@emph@{@{date@}@} using
     @@uref@{@{program_homepage@}, @@emph@{@{program@}@}@}.',
    @{
    'date' => $date,
    'program_homepage' => $Texi2HTML::THISDOC@{'program_homepage'@},
    'program' => $Texi2HTML::THISDOC@{'program_and_version'@} @},
    @{'duplicate'=>1,
   @});
@end example

This approach is a bit complicated.  What is useful is that it
supports having translations available in different encodings for
encodings which can be covered by @@-commands, and also specifying how
the formatting for some commands is done, independently of the output
format yet still be language dependent.  For example, a
@samp{@@pxref} translation string may be:

@example
see @{node_file_href@} section `@{section@}\' in @@cite@{@{book@}@}
@end example

@noindent
which allows specifying a string independently of the output format
but with a rich formatting that may be translated appropriately in
many languages.

Expansion can be prevented via @code{keep_texi} in the @code{state} hash.

When a @code{@@documentlanguage} line appears in the document and the
language was not set on the command line, it is convenient for the
translations to redefine some variables based on the new language.
Therefore, Texinfo has a function reference which is called each time
@code{@@documentlanguage} is encountered:

@deffn {Function Reference} $translate_names
This function is called each time @code{@@documentlanguage} is
encountered and the language was not set on the command line.  It
should be used to retranslate strings based on the new language.

@node The different elements
@subsection The different elements

The main division of output document is the @dfn{element}.  Their
association with output files is determined by the split options.
@xref{Splitting output}.
The elements are:

@c The association of nodes with pages is
@c determined by the splitting of the document. @xref{Splitting output}.
@table @emph
@item Normal elements
These are normal sections and nodes.  In general nodes are associated 
with the following sectioning command and a sectioning command is associated
with the previous node and they both together make up
the element.  Either the node or the sectioning command is considered to 
be the main element component, depending on the value of 
@code{USE_NODES} and @code{USE_SECTIONS}.  For example, if output 
is Info, the nodes are the elements, if output is Docbook, sectioning commands
are the main element component, and if output is HTML both cases may happen.  
@xref{Two Paths}.
@item Top element
The top element is the higher element in the document structure.
If there is a @code{@@top} section it is the element associated with
that section. Otherwise it is the element associated with the 
@code{@@node Top}.  If there is no @code{@@node Top} the first element 
is the top element.

The top element may be formatted differently from normal elements if there
is a @code{@@top} section or the @code{@@node Top} is not associated 
with a sectioning command.
@item Misc elements
These elements are associated with different files if the document is split.
And also if @code{MONOLITHIC} is not set.
There are four misc elements:
@enumerate
@item Table of contents
@item Short table of contents, also called Overview
@item Footnotes page
@item About page
@end enumerate

The @emph{About page} shouldn't be present for documents consisting
in only one sectioning element, or for documents unsplit and without
navigation information.  When generating HTML, 
the @emph{Footnote page} should only
be present if the footnotes appear on a separated page,
(@pxref{Footnote Styles}) however a footnote element is present if
the document isn't split.  The @emph{Table of contents} should only
be formatted if @code{@@contents} is present in the document.
Similarly the @emph{Overview} should only appear if @code{@@shortcontents}
or @code{@@summarycontents} is present.  Corresponding configuration variables,
@code{contents} and @code{shortcontents} may be set to trigger the 
output of a @emph{Table of contents} or @emph{Overview}.  
The Table of contents and 
the Overview may also be directly included within the document, not
as separate pages, in case @code{INLINECONTENTS} is set 
(@pxref{Contents and Overview text}).


It is common not to have anything by normal elements, especially in 
case of non split output.  In case of HTML output, special element may
be present.
@end table

The main component of elements are sections if @code{USE_SECTIONS} is set,
or @code{USE_NODES} is set to 0, and, conversely, are nodes if 
@code{USE_NODES} is set or @code{USE_SECTIONS} is 0.  If those configuration
variables are undefined, heuristics are used, influenced by the presence of
nodes or sectioning elements in the document, if there are no nodes, 
sectioning elements are preferred and the reverse is true if there are no
sectioning commands.
 
When sectioning commands are the main components of elements, 
nodes not directly associated with a sectioning command are 
associated with the following sectioning command, 
and sectioning commands without nodes constitute an element.
Conversely, when nodes are the main component of elements,
sectioning commands not associated with nodes are associated with the
previous node, and lone nodes are elements.


@node Elements informations
@subsection Elements informations


The following items are associated with elements.  Each of these
is associated with a name and a reference to the 
element they represent, when such an element exists. 
The element is either a global element (for example the first element)
or an element relative to the current
element (for example the next element).  The relative elements are 
found with respect with the document
structure defined by the section structuring commands (@code{@@chapter}, 
@code{@@unnumbered}@dots{}) or by the nodes (in that case the node 
directions are specified on node line or in menu organization), as explained
above (@pxref{Two Paths}).
These items are called @dfn{element labels}.  They may be associated with 
a button (@pxref{Button specifications}), and used in the formatting functions 
(@pxref{Elements informations}).

Here is the list:

@table @emph
@item @samp{@ }
An empty button
@item Top
Top element. The associated name is @code{TOP_HEADING} if that variable is 
defined. This variable is not set by default.
@item Contents
Table of contents
@item About
About (help) page
@item Overview
Overview, short table of contents
@item First
First element in reading order
@item Last
Last element in reading order
@item Index
The first chapter with @code{@@printindex}.  The associated name 
is @code{$INDEX_CHAPTER}, if the variable is set.  This variable is not set
by default.
@item This
The current element
@item Back
Preceding element in reading order
@item FastBack
Beginning of this chapter or previous chapter if the element is a chapter
@item Prev
Previous section on the same level 
@item NodePrev
Previous node
@item Forward 
Next element in reading order
@item FastForward
Next chapter
@item Next
Next section on the same level
@item NodeNext
Next node
@item Following
Next node in node reading order
@item Up
Up section
@item NodeUp
Up node
@item FileNext
Forward element first in the next page (or file)
@item FilePrev
Backward element first in the previous page (or file)
@end table


The element labels may also be accessed when formatting elements.
Four hashes are available, with key the elements items, and values:

@vtable @code
@item %Texi2HTML::NAME
The formatted element name
@item %Texi2HTML::HREF
The element hypertext reference
@item %Texi2HTML::NODE
The element node name
@item %Texi2HTML::NO_TEXI
The element name after removal of texi commands
@end vtable

For example @code{$Texi2HTML::NAME@{'Back'@}} is the name of the
previous element in reading order.


@node Elements lines
@subsection Elements lines

The following array references or arrays holds formatted lines:

@vtable @code
@item $Texi2HTML::THIS_SECTION

@node Navigation panel customization
@section Customization of the navigation panels

A lot of customization of the navigation panel may be achieved
with variables redefinition, especially special arrays.
The configuration variables @code{VERTICAL_HEAD_NAVIGATION}, @code{ICONS},
@code{HEADERS}, @code{HEADER_IN_TABLE}, @code{USE_ACCESSKEY} and
@code{USE_REL_REV}
may be used to change the the navigation panel formatting.
@xref{makeinfo Configuration Variables}.
In case it isn't enough, it is also possible to redefine the function 
doing the navigation panel formatting.

@end menu


@node Button specifications
@subsection Specifying the buttons formatting

Several arrays and hashes enable a precise control on the buttons and 
their display. 
The following arrays determine the buttons present in navigation panels:

@vtable @code
@item @@SECTION_BUTTONS
This array is used for the navigation panel buttons present at the begining
of sectioning elements. If split at node or section they are also used 
at the page footer, and in the case of section navigation at the page header.
@item @@SECTION_FOOTER_BUTTONS
@itemx @@NODE_FOOTER_BUTTONS
This array is used for the navigation panel buttons present at the footer
of pages when split at node or at section. 

If @code{WORDS_IN_PAGE} is set and the output is split at nodes, these 
buttons are only present if there are more than @code{WORDS_IN_PAGE}
words in the sectioning element text.  This counting is very rough and include
punctuation marks, html elements, numbers.  The default is to include the
buttons after 300 words.
@item @@CHAPTER_BUTTONS
This array is used for the buttons appearing at the page footer if split at 
chapter, and at the page header if split at chapter and there is no section
navigation.
@item @@MISC_BUTTONS
These buttons appear at the beginning of special and sections  
and at the end of these section pages if the output is split.
@item @@LINKS_BUTTONS
These are used for @code{<link>} elements if they are output in the
headers.
@item @@TOP_BUTTONS
This array is used for the top element buttons (@pxref{The different elements}).
@end vtable

The array specify the buttons displayed in navigation panels, 
and how the button is displayed.
Each element is associated with
a button of the navigation panel from left to right.
The signification of the array element value is the following:

@table @emph
@item reference on a function
The function is called with argument a boolean true if the navigation 
panel should be vertical.  Should return the formatted button text.
@item reference on a scalar
The scalar value is printed. For some possibly
usefull scalars, @ref{Elements informations}.
@item reference on an array
In this case the first array element should be a reference on text and the 
second element an element label.  In that case a link to the 
element associated with the element label with the scalar value
text is generated.

For example if the buttons array element is
@example
[ 'Next', \$Texi2HTML::NODE@{Next@} ] 
@end example

@vindex %NAVIGATION_TEXT
The button will be a link to the next section with text 
@code{$Texi2HTML::NODE@{Next@}}.
@item element label
If icons are not used, the button is a link to the corresponding
element which text is defined by the value associated with the 
element label in the @code{%NAVIGATION_TEXT} hash, surrounded
by @samp{[} and @samp{]}. If the element label is @samp{ }, there is
no @samp{[} and @samp{]}. 
The element of the @code{%NAVIGATION_TEXT} hash are defined 
dynamically, in the @code{init_out} function reference
(@pxref{Output initialization}).

@vindex %ACTIVE_ICONS
@vindex %BUTTONS_NAME
@vindex %PASSIVE_ICONS
@vindex %NAVIGATION_TEXT
If icons are used, the button is an image with file determined by
the value associated with the element label in the @code{%ACTIVE_ICONS}
hash if the the link really leads to an element, or in the @code{%PASSIVE_ICONS}
hash if there is no element to link to.  Of course if there is a link to the 
element the icon links to that element.  The button name and 
the button description are used in HTML attributes to have a textual 
description of the icon.  The corresponding strings are in 
@code{%BUTTONS_NAME} for the button name and @code{%NAVIGATION_TEXT}
for the description.
@end table

@vindex %BUTTONS_ACCESSKEY
If the configuration variable @code{USE_ACCESSKEY} is set, 
the @code{accesskey} attribute is used in navigation.  In that case 
the @code{%BUTTONS_ACCESSKEY} hash is used for the access key.

@vindex %BUTTONS_REL
Similarly, if the @code{USE_REL_REV} configuration variable is set, 
the @code{rel} attribute is used in navigation.  In that case 
the @code{%BUTTONS_REL} hash is used for the @code{rel} attribute.


@node Panel formatting function
@subsection Changing the navigation panel formatting

If you are not satisfied with this scheme, it is possible to
control exactly the formatting of navigation panels by redefining a function 
reference.  The function controlling the display of navigation panel is 
associated with the following function reference:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $navigation_text print_navigation \@@buttons $vertical
@var{\@@buttons} is an array reference which should hold the specification of 
the buttons for that navigation panel.  
@var{$vertical} is true if the navigation panel should be vertical.
Returns the formatted navigation panel in @var{$navigation_text}.
@end deftypefn

You may also only redefine the function reference @code{button_formatting}
that does the formatting of one button:
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $formatted_button button_formatting $button $vertical
@var{$button} hold the specification of the button as explained above.
@var{$vertical} is true if the navigation panel should be vertical.
@end deftypefn

The default functions call the function associated with 
@code{$print_head_navigation} to format the navigation panel for the 
page header.  Thus you can control parts of the formatting by
redefining the function reference.  This function reference 
does nothing except for HTML.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $page_head print_head_navigation $filehandle \@@buttons $first_in_page $previous_is_top \%element
@var{$filehandle} is the opened filehandle the function should write to,
if defined. If not defined the function should return the formatted
page head.
@var{\@@buttons} is an array reference which should hold the specification of 
the buttons for the navigation panel. 
@var{$first_in_page} should be set if this is the first navigation
panel in the page.
@var{$previous_is_top} is true if the previous element is the top
element.
@var{\%element} is a reference on a hash holding informations about
the element.
@end deftypefn

Similarly, the default functions call the function associated with 
@code{$print_foot_navigation} to format the navigation panel for the 
page footer, in HTML, the only format with page footers in the
default case.  Thus you can control parts of the formatting by
redefining the function reference.

@deffn {Function Reference} print_foot_navigation $filehandle \@@buttons $rule $print_navigation_panel \%element $maybe_in_page
@var{$filehandle} is the opened filehandle the function should write to.
@var{\@@buttons} is an array reference which should hold the specification of 
the buttons for the navigation panel.
@var{rule} is a rule that may be used to separate the navigation panel
from the preceding text.
@var{$print_navigation_panel} is a boolean that say wether it would make
sense to print the navigation panel itself.
@var{\%element} is a reference on a hash holding informations about
the element being finished.
@var{$maybe_in_page} is set if called between regular elements and top or 
between regular elements and special elements, that is, not at
the end of a file.

@node Customizing file header
@subsection Customizing file header 

You can have full control over the file header 
formatting by redefining three function references.  The function associated
with @code{$print_page_head} is called for all the pages, and after that,
the function associated with @code{$print_chapter_header} is called
if the document is split at chapters, or the function associated with
@code{$print_section_header} is called if the document is split at sections.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} print_page_head $filehandle
@var{$filehandle} is the opened filehandle the function should write to.
In HTML, this function should print the page head, including the @code{<body>}
element.
@end deftypefn

@deffn {Function Reference} print_chapter_header $filehandle \%element
@var{$filehandle} is the opened filehandle the function should write to.
@var{\%element} is a reference on a hash holding informations about the element.
This function is called if the document is split at chapters, after 
@code{print_page_head}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Function Reference} print_section_header $filehandle \%element
@var{$filehandle} is the opened filehandle the function should write to.
@var{\%element} is a reference on a hash holding informations about the element.
This function is called if the document is split at sections, after 
@code{print_page_head}.
@end deffn

@vindex $EXTRA_HEAD
@vindex $AFTER_BODY_OPEN
In HTML,
it is possible to add lines to the text within the @code{<head>} 
@acronym{HTML} elements, by defining the variable @code{$EXTRA_HEAD}.
Similarly it is possible to add text just after the @code{<body>} 
element with the variable @code{$AFTER_BODY_OPEN}.
These variables are empty by default.
A date is output in header
if @code{DATE_IN_HEADER} is set.
Also, the description from @code{@@documentdescription} (or set as
a configuration variable) is used in the 
header (@pxref{documentdescription}).

The @code{<body>} element attributes may be set by defining the
configuration variable @code{BODYTEXT}.  
In the default case, the encoding name @code{ENCODING_NAME} is used.
If the variable is not defined,
it is automatically determined 
@xref{Encodings}.

@vindex @@LINKS_BUTTONS
@vindex %BUTTONS_REL
@code{<link>} element are used in the header if @code{USE_LINKS}
is set.  @code{@@LINKS_BUTTONS} determines which links are used.
@code{%BUTTONS_REL} determines the link type associated with the
@code{rel} attribute.

@node Customizing the section layout
@subsection Customizing the section layout

The functions associated with the following function references are used for 
the formatting of sections:

@deffn {Function Reference} print_section $filehandle $first_in_page $previous_is_top \%element
@var{$filehandle} is the opened filehandle the function should write to.
@var{$first_in_page} is true if this section is the first section in the page.
@var{$previous_is_top} is true if this section is the section following the 
Top section.
@var{\%element} is a reference on a hash holding informations about the element.
This function should print the current section contents.
@end deffn

@deffn {Function Reference} end_section $filehandle $last_element_or_before_top \%element
@var{$filehandle} is the opened filehandle the function should write to.
@var{$last_element_or_before_top} is true if this section precedes the top 
element or is the last one in page, or before the special elements.
@var{\%element} is a reference on a hash holding informations about the element.
@end deffn

@node Customizing file footers
@subsection Customizing the file footers

You can have full control over the file footer 
formatting by redefining three function references.
The function associated with @code{$print_chapter_footer} is called
if the document is split at chapters, or the function associated with
@code{$print_section_footer} is called if the document is split at sections.
After that the function associated with @code{$print_page_foot} is called.

@deffn {Function Reference} print_page_foot $filehandle
@var{$filehandle} is the opened filehandle the function should write to.
This function should print the page foot, including the @code{</body>}
element.
@end deffn

@deffn {Function Reference} print_chapter_footer $filehandle \%element
@var{$filehandle} is the opened filehandle the function should write to.
This function is called if the document is split at chapters, before 
@code{print_page_foot}.
@var{\%element} is a reference on a hash holding informations about the element.
@end deffn

@deffn {Function Reference} print_section_footer $filehandle \%element
@var{$filehandle} is the opened filehandle the function should write to.
This function is called if the document is split at sections, before
@code{print_page_foot}.
@var{\%element} is a reference on a hash holding informations about the element.
@end deffn

@vindex $PRE_BODY_CLOSE
In HTML, it is possible to add text just before the @code{</body>} 
element with the variable @code{$PRE_BODY_CLOSE}.  Nothing is added
by default.  If @code{PROGRAM_NAME_IN_FOOTER} is set, the date and the 
program name that generated the output manual is output in the footer.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $misc_element_label misc_element_label $identifier $page_name
@var{$identifier} is the identifier associated with the special element.
@var{$page_name} is the special element name.  It should return a label that

@node Top element text
@subsubsection Top element text formatting

The top element formatting is controlled by three function which also
controls the layout of the top element page or section.  The associated
function references are:

@deffn {Function Reference} print_Top_header $filehandle $begin_page
@var{$filehandle} is the opened filehandle the function should write to.
@var{$begin_page} is true if the element is the first in a page.
This function should begin the Top element.  At the time this function 
is called, the top element text has not been parsed.
@end deffn

@deffn {Function Reference} print_Top $filehandle $has_top_heading \%element
@var{$filehandle} is the opened filehandle the function should write to.
@var{$has_top_heading} is true if there is a @code{@@heading} command or
@code{@@titlefont} command appearing in the Top element text.
@var{\%element} is a reference on a hash holding informations about the element.
This function should be used to format the Top element text and navigation
panel.
@end deffn

@deffn {Function Reference} print_Top_footer $filehandle $end_page \%element
@var{$filehandle} is the opened filehandle the function should write to.
@var{$end_page} is true if the element is the last in a page.
@var{\%element} is a reference on a hash holding informations about the element.
This function should end the Top element. 
@end deffn

@node Contents and Overview text
@subsubsection Table of contents and Short table of contents

Two possibilities exist for the formatting of table of contents (and 
short table of contents).  In the default case @code{INLINE_CONTENTS}
is set, in that case the table of contents
are not output as separate elements but are instead output where the 
corresponding @@-command, for example @code{@@contents},
is set.  This behavior is consistent with @command{texi2dvi}.
If @code{INLINE_CONTENTS} is not set,  the table of contents 
are in separate elements, at the end of the document if the document 
is unsplit or in separate files.  This makes sense when
menus are used for navigation.
If @code{@@setcontentsaftertitlepage} appears in the document,
and even if @code{INLINE_CONTENTS} is set, the table of contents are 
merged in the title (which isn't output in the default case, see 
@ref{Title page text}).

Several variables may be used to control the formatting of table of contents 
and short table of contents:

@vtable @code
@item $BEFORE_OVERVIEW
The variable value is inserted before the short table of contents text.
@item $AFTER_OVERVIEW
The variable value is inserted after the short table of contents text.
@item $BEFORE_TOC_LINES
The variable value is inserted before the table of contents text.
@item $AFTER_TOC_LINES
The variable value is inserted after the table of contents text.
@item $NO_BULLET_LIST_STYLE
For HTML.
This should contain a CSS style used for the list style when there
is no bullet.
@item $NO_BULLET_LIST_CLASS
This should contain the class assocciated with the $NO_BULLET_LIST_STYLE 
css style.
@item $NO_BULLET_LIST_ATTRIBUTE
This should contain an attribute text used for the list element when there
is no bullet.  For example it is used in the tables of if they are 
formatted with a list.
@end vtable

More control on the table of contents and short table of contents formatting
may be achieved by redefining a function with the following associated 
function reference:

@deffn {Function Reference} toc_body \@@elements 
@var{\@@elements} is an array reference contining informations about
all the elements of the document.  Each of the entry of this array is an hash
reference which entries correspond with different informations
about the element.  Interesting keys have the following meaning:

@table @code
@item top
true if the element is the top element,
@item index_page
true if the element is an index page added because of index splitting,
@item toc_level
level of the element in the table of content.  Highest level
is 1 for the top element and for chapters, appendix and so on,
2 for section, unnumberedsec and so on...
@item tocid
label used for reference linking to the element in table of
contents,
@item file 
the file containing the element, usefull to do href to that file
in case the document is split,
@item text
text of the element, with section number,
@item name
text of the element, without section number.
@end table

This function doesn't return anything but should fill the array corresponding
with the @code{$Texi2HTML::TOC_LINES} and @code{$Texi2HTML::OVERVIEW} 
references with the table of contents and short table of contents.  
@xref{Elements lines}.

@end deffn

In the default case, this function reference calls two specialized
function reference, one for contents and the other for shortcontents.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} \@@contents_lines contents \@@elements $contents_file
@var{\@@elements} is an array reference contining informations about
all the elements of the document, as above.
@var{$contents_file} is the name of the file containing the table of
contents.
This function should return the formatted table of contents lines.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {Function Reference} \@@shortcontents_lines shortcontents \@@elements $shortcontents_file
@var{\@@elements} is an array reference contining informations about
all the elements of the document, as above.
@var{$shortcontents_file} is the name of the file containing the table of
contents.
This function should return the formatted overview (short table of contents) lines.
@end deftypefn

Another function reference is used to add a heading and a reference, to
be used with @code{INLINE_CONTENTS} or merged in the title.  Its output
is not used when the table of contents are separate elements.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} \@@inline_contents_lines inline_contents $filehandle $command \%element \@@elements
This function reference returns a reference on an array holding 
the lines containing the contents, heading and reference.
@var{$filehandle} is a reference on the currently opened file if
the function is called because a @code{@@contents} or
@code{@@shortcontents} command was encountered, it is undef otherwise.
@var{$command} is either @samp{contents} or @samp{shortcontents}.
@var{\%element} is a reference on a hash holding informations about the element
where the contents appeared.
Relevant keys are:
@table @code
@item target
The identifier associated with the table of contents, used for example
to do references to the table of contents using href in @acronym{HTML}.
@item id
The identifier associated with the element, used to do labels. In 
general the same than the @code{target}, but not necessarily.
@item file
The file name containing the table of contents.
@end table
@var{\@@elements} is an array reference contining informations about
all the elements of the document, as above.
@end deftypefn

@node Footnotes text
@subsubsection Formatting of footnotes text

The footnotes text is already formatting when @code{@@footnote} commands
are expanded. 
@xref{Footnotes formatting}.

@node About text
@subsubsection Formatting of about text

The default about element contains an explaination of the buttons used
in the document (@code{@@SECTION_BUTTONS}, @ref{Button specifications}) and 
an example locating the buttons targets in an example.
The formatting of this text may be influenced by the following 
hashes and variables:

@table @code
@item $PRE_ABOUT 
@itemx $AFTER_ABOUT
This variable may be a scalar or a function reference. 
If it is a scalar, the value is used.
If this is a function reference it is expanded and the returned text is
used. The text is added before or after the main about text.
@item %BUTTONS_GOTO

The keys of this hash are element labels (@pxref{Elements informations}).  
The value is the text associated with the element label in the about text.
In the default case, the element of the hash are defined dynamically in 
that the @code{init_out} function reference (@pxref{Output initialization}).


@item %BUTTONS_EXAMPLE

The keys of this hash are  element labels (@pxref{Elements informations}). 
The value is the text associated with the element label in the about 
example, typically a section number.

@end table

If this is not enough and you want to control exactly the formatting of
the about text, you can redefine the function associated with the following 
function reference:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $about_text about_body
This function should return the about text.
@end deftypefn

@node Title page text
@subsubsection Formatting of title page

@vindex $Texi2HTML::TITLEPAGE
The title page is first formatted using the text appearing in 
the @code{@@titlepage} section, and put in @code{$Texi2HTML::TITLEPAGE}
(@pxref{Elements lines}).  More formatting can be done using the following
function reference:

@deffn {Function Reference} titlepage \@@titlepage_lines $text $comment $simple_text
@var{\@@titlepage_lines} is an array containing the Texinfo lines in @code{@@titlepage}.
@var{$text} is the text appearing in @code{@@titlepage}, formatted.
@var{$comment} is the text with texi removed, should be very simple
text.  
@var{$simple_text} is the text formatted in string context
with minimal formatting but no elements.
This function should complete @code{$Texi2HTML::TITLEPAGE}.
@end deffn

In the default case, in this function the title is output if 
there is no titlepage, the table of contents and short
table of contents are also added if they are to be output and 
@code{@@setcontentsaftertitlepage}
or @code{@@setshortcontentsaftertitlepage} appear in the document
(@pxref{Contents and Overview text}).

The resulting title page output is used in the document if 
@code{USE_TITLEPAGE_FOR_TITLE} and @code{SHOW_TITLE} are set.

@node Special elements layout
@subsection Customizing the layout of the special element pages

The formatting of each of the special pages, or section in case 
the document is not split, is controlled by a function.
The associated function reference is called accordingly:

@ftable @code
@item print_Top
@item print_Top_header
@item print_Top_footer
Formatting of top element page or section. It is also used for the formatting
of the top element text (@pxref{Top element text}).
@item print_Toc
Formatting of table of contents page or section.
@item print_Overview
Formatting of short table of contents page or section.
@item print_About
Formatting of about (help) page or section.
@item print_Footnotes
Formatting of footnotes section or page in case footnotes are on a 
separated page or the document is not split.
@end ftable

In the default case, @code{$print_Top} calls @code{$print_Top_header} for
the header and @code{$print_Top_footer} for the footer of top element.
All the other function call @code{$print_misc} which in turn calls
@code{$print_misc_header} for the headers and @code{$print_misc_footer} 
for the footers.

@node File and target names
@section Customizing the file and target names

@subheading File names

It is possible to specify the file names with more control than with the
command line options (@option{--output}). The configuration variables
@code{PREFIX}, @code{TOP_FILE} and @code{TOC_FILE} may be used. 
The extension may also be overriden by the configuration variable 
@code{EXTENSION}
value.  The variable should be @code{undef} if no extension is
to be added.

Two function references enable 
further customization.  One is especially usefull in case 
@code{NODE_FILES} is true
and it is used to customize the node file name. 

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $node_file node_file_name \%node $type
@var{\%node} is a hash reference with the following interesting keys (there
are much more keys):
@table @code
@item texi
The texinfo node name.
@item with_section
True if associated with a section.
@end table
@var{$type} is @code{top} if the node is the top node.
The result is the node file name @var{$node_file}.
@end deftypefn

The other is used to
customize the file names associated with each element, and the 
name of the file associated with the special elements. 
@xref{The different elements}.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $file element_file_name \%element $type $docu_name
@var{\%element} is undefined for the special elements (about, overview, 
table of contents, footnotes).
Otherwise it is a hash reference with the following interesting keys (there
are much more keys):
@table @code
@item texi
The texinfo element name.
@item number
The number associated with a section.
@item doc_nr
A number incremented whenever a new file should begin, based on how the 
document is split (@pxref{Splitting output}).
@item text
The element text.
@item name
The element text without section number.
@end table
@var{$type} is empty for normal elements. 
For the top element it is @samp{top}, for the table of contents it 
is @samp{toc}, for the overview it is @samp{stoc}, for the
footnotes it is @samp{foot} and for about is @samp{about}.  If 
frames are used with @code{FRAMES}, the function reference
is also called for @samp{frame}, the frame file name, and 
@samp{toc_frame} the table of content frame file name.
@var{$docu_name} is the basename of the texinfo manual.
The result is the element or special element file name.
@end deftypefn

@vindex %renamed_nodes
It is also possible to specify renamed node names in @code{%renamed_nodes}.
They will be processed as explained in @ref{HTML Xref Link Preservation}.

@subheading target names

Similarly target and id may be set.  The @dfn{id} is placed where the 
item is located, the @dfn{target} is used to construct references to
that item. In general they should be equal, but not always, for example
in the default case, the target for a section is the node id.
The following function reference, is
for target items (nodes, anchors, floats):

@deftypefn {Function Reference} {($target,$id)} node_target_name \%node $default_target $default_id $type
@var{\%node} is the same as in the @code{node_file_name} function reference
above.
@var{$default_target} is the target already set (it is also 
in @code{$node->@{'target'@}}), and @var{$default_id} is similarly
the id already set.
@var{$type} is @code{top} if the node is the top node.
@end deftypefn

For element (@pxref{The different elements}), the function 
reference is:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} {($target,$id)} element_target_name \%element $default_target $default_id
the @var{\%element} is the same than in @code{element_file_name}, and
@var{$default_target} and @var{$default_id} are the target and id already set.
@end deftypefn

Placed items 
(floats, footnotes, index entries, anchors, contents,
shortcontents and headings)
file and target may also be set.  In the default case, they should 
be rightly set, so be careful when changing them.  The following 
function reference can be used:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} {($target, $id, $file)} placed_target_file_name \%placed_item \%element $default_target $default_id $default_file $context
@var{\%placed_item} is a hash reference describing the placed item,
in the same vein than above.
the @var{\%element} is the same than in @code{element_file_name}, 
corresponding with the element containing the placed item.
@var{$default_file}, @var{default_id} and
@var{$default_target} are the file, id and target already set.
@var{$context} describes the context, it is empty in the normal cases, 
and can also be set to @samp{footnotes} if in footnotes, or to
@samp{no_associated_element} if the placed item is out of any element
(typically in @code{@@titlepage}, @code{@@copying}).
@end deftypefn

@vindex %misc_pages_targets
For special elements, the @code{%misc_pages_targets} hash is 
used to set the target and id.  The possibilities for the keys 
are @samp{Overview}, @samp{Contents}, @samp{Footnotes} and @samp{About}.

@node Headings formatting
@section Customizing headings formatting

A function reference may be used to do the formatting
of the heading text (in general changing font and underlining):
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $heading_text_formatted heading_text $command $text $level
@var{$command} is the @@-command name associated with the heading.
@var{$text} is the heading @@-command argument, formatted.
@var{$level} is the level of the heading in the document tree.
@end deftypefn
@findex heading_text_preformatted
A similar function reference is available for preformatted context,
@code{heading_text_preformatted}.

A function controls the formatting of element headings, @code{heading}.  
In the default case it mainly determines if the @code{heading_text} function
reference should be called for this element, for example it is
common not to output any heading text for a node, only
for associated sectioning elements (@pxref{Two Paths}). 
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $heading_text heading \%element $command $command_texi_arg $formatted_arg $in_preformatted $one_section $element_heading
The @var{\%element} is a reference on a hash corresponding
with the sectioning element.  The following keys are of interest:
@table @code
@item text
The heading text
@item text_nonumber
The heading text without section number
@item node
true if the sectioning element is a node without associated structuring command
@item level
The level of the element in the document tree.  @samp{0} is for @code{@@top},
@samp{1} for @code{@@chapter} and so on
@item tag_level
the sectioning element name, with @code{@@raisesections} and 
@code{@@lowersections} taken into account
@item top
true if it is the top element
@end table
@var{$command} is the 
heading @@-command.  @var{$command_texi_arg} is the argument of the 
@@-command, unformatted.  @var{$formatted_arg} is is the argument of the 
@@-command, formatted.  @var{$in_preformatted} is true if in preformatted 
environment.  @var{$one_section} is true if there is only one 
section.  @var{$element_heading} is set if the heading is the main component
of the element.
@end deftypefn

It is also possible to customize the heading text with section number
with the following function reference (called for headings and nodes):
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $result_texi heading_texi $heading_command $heading $number
@var{$heading_command} is the sectioning @@-command of that heading. 
@var{$heading} is the texinfo for that heading.  @var{$number} is the
heading number classicaly computed with dots between numbers, and
letters for top level appendix numbering.  This function should return the 
texinfo text corresponding with the numbered heading.
@end deftypefn

The label associated with the heading that can appear before the 
heading itself and even before the navigation panel is customized with the
following function reference:
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $element_label element_label $identifier \%element $command $unformatted_line
@var{$identifier} is the identifier associated with the heading.
@var{\%element} is the same as above.  @var{$command} is 
the @@-command appearing on the line, and @var{$unformatted_line} is 
the line, unformatted.
@end deftypefn

Additionally, for @code{@@node} and sectioning @@-commands the formatting
of the label, navigation panel and heading is controlled by:
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $element_heading_text element_heading \%element $command $command_texi_arg $formatted_arg $in_preformatted $one_section $element_heading $first_in_page $is_top $previous_is_top $unformatted_line $element_id $new_element
@var{\%element} is the same as above.
@var{$command} is the 
heading @@-command.  @var{$command_texi_arg} is the argument of the 
@@-command, unformatted.  @var{$formatted_arg} is is the argument of the 
@@-command, formatted.  @var{$in_preformatted} is true if in preformatted 
environment.  @var{$one_section} is true if there is only one 
section.  @var{$element_heading} is set if the heading is the main component
of the element.
@var{$first_in_page} is true if this is the first heading in a page.
@var{$is_top} is true if the heading is considered as a top element heading.
@var{$previous_is_top} is true if the previous helement was a top element.

@node Formatting commands without arguments
@subsection Customizing the formatting of commands without argument

This includes the commands whose name is a nonletter character like @code{@@@@}, 
the commands with lettered characters and braces
but whose braces should be empty, like @code{@@TeX@{@}}, or some commands
associated with accentted letters like @code{@@AA@{@}}. 

Each of these categories of commands have associated hashes,
for normal
context, for preformatted context for strings and math. 
(@pxref{Four contexts}).  The 
keys of the hashes are the 
command names, the associated value is the text replacing the command.
In math context if a command is not a key of these hashes, the 
defaults for this command are used.

@vindex %simple_map
@vindex %simple_map_pre
@vindex simple_map_texi
@vindex %things_map
@vindex %pre_map
@vindex %texi_map
@vindex %simple_map_math
@vindex %math_map
The hashes are:
@multitable {preformatted text} {one nonlettered character} {nothing in braces}
@headitem command type @tab one nonlettered character @tab nothing in braces
@item normal text @tab @code{%simple_map} @tab @code{%things_map}
@item preformatted text @tab @code{%simple_map_pre} @tab @code{%pre_map}
@item string @tab @code{%simple_map_texi} @tab @code{%texi_map}
@item math @tab @code{%simple_map_math} @tab @code{%math_map}
@end multitable

To change the formatting of these commands, just change the
value. For example, if you want @code{&shy;} to be outputted for @code{@@-}
in normal and preformatted context, write in your init file:

@example
$simple_map@{'-'@} = '&shy;';
$simple_map_pre@{'-'@} = '&shy;';
@end example

A special hash is used preferentially when sorting indices, 
overriding @code{%texi_map} entries, @code{%sorting_things_map}.

For a better control, function references are available,
although they are not used in string context.
@code{simple_command} is for one nonlettered character
@@-command formatting:
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $formatted_command simple_command $command $in_preformatted $in_math $line_nr \%state
@var{$command} is the @@-command name.
@var{$in_preformatted} is true if in preformatted region.
@var{$in_math} is true if in math.
@var{$line_nr}
An opaque structure containing the information about the line number of the 
@@-command.
@var{\%state} holds informations about the current context. 
@end deftypefn

For @@-commands without argument in brace, @code{thing_command}
may be redefined:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $formatted_command thing_command $command $text $in_preformatted $in_math $line_nr \%state
@var{$command} is the @@-command name.
@var{$text} is the formatted text appearing in the @@-command. It is invalid Texinfo to have
something else than an empty string.
@var{$in_preformatted} is true if in preformatted region.
@var{$in_math} is true if in math.
@var{$line_nr}
An opaque structure containing the information about the line number of the 
@@-command.
@var{\%state} holds informations about the current context. 
@end deftypefn



@node Formatting of @@<colon>
@subsection Formatting of a punctuation character associated with @code{@@:}

@vindex %colon_command_punctuation_characters
The formatting of a punctuation character followed by @code{@@:} is determined
by the hash @code{%colon_command_punctuation_characters}.  If a @code{@@:}
command is preceded by a character in th is hash, it is replaced by the 
associated value.  In the default case, the associated value is also the 
character, so this leave the punctuation character unmodified.

The following function reference may be redefined to handle characters
that are in @code{%colon_command_punctuation_characters}:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $punctuation $colon_command $character
The @var{$character} is a character appearing in 
@code{%colon_command_punctuation_characters} and preceding a @code{@@:} 
command. In the default case the associated value in
@code{%colon_command_punctuation_characters} is returned.
@end deftypefn

@node Formatting of style and accents
@subsection Customizing accent, style and other simple commands with braces

@vindex %style_map
@vindex %style_map_pre
@vindex %style_map_texi
@vindex %style_map_math
The formatting of the output produced by font and indicatric 
commands (@code{@@tt}, @code{@@code}, @code{@@titlefont}), the accentuation related
commands taking argument (@code{@@'}, @code{@@udotaccent}, @code{@@dotless})
and miscalleneous commands (@code{@@email}, @code{@@verb}, @code{@@w}, 
@code{@@uref}, @code{@@math}, @code{@@asis}) is controlled by hashes in the
default case, 
@code{%style_map} for normal context, @code{%style_map_pre} for
preformatted context and @code{%style_map_texi} in string context (@pxref{Four contexts}).
In math context, @code{%style_map_math} is tried first and, if not found,
other hashes are used.

If defined, a function reference is called for the @@-command opening:

@deffn {Function Reference} begin_style_texi $command \%state \@@stack $real_style_or_accent $remove_texi
@var{$command} is the @@-command name. 
@var{\%state} holds informations about the current context. 
@var{\@@stack} is an opaque variable.
@var{$real_style_or_accent} is set if the command is an accent or is a
marking of font command.
@var{$remove_texi} is set if in a context where output is some simple
text.
@end deffn

The key of the hashes are the command names.
@c There are two possibilities for
@c the values corresponding with two interfaces. 
The values may be strings or 
hash references.
@c and you can chose the interface depending on the one you prefer. 
The interface with hash reference is the only one described in this
manual, the other is mostly retained for backward compatibility.
If you don't like these interfaces you
can define your own.

Some remarks are in order:

@itemize
@item 
@vindex %accent_map
The nonlettered accent commands which following character is considered
to be the argument (like in @code{@@`a}) should be keys of the
hash @code{%accent_map} hash, even if no value is associated.
@item
Command with braces may be handled differently, as described in
@ref{External formatting of commands}, this is used 
for @code{@@math} if La@TeX{}2HTML is used, for example.

@end menu

@node Hash reference interface
@subsubsection An interface for commands formatting with a hash reference

The key of the hashes are the command names. The value determine how the command argument
is formatted. This value is a reference on a hash. In this hash each key 
corresponds with a type of information for the formatting, and the value is 
the corresponding information. For example, in 

@example
$style_map@{'command'@} = @{ 'args' => ['code'], 'inline_attribute' => 'code'@};
@end example

the arguments for @code{@@command} are interpreted as specified by 
the values associated with the @samp{args} key while the inline_attribute 
associated 
with that command is @samp{code}.

The following keys in the hashes associated with each command have the
following meaning:

@table @samp
@item args
@anchor{Reference hash args}
The value associated is a reference on an array.  Each element of the array
defines how the arguments (separated by @samp{,} in the texinfo code) for 
the @@-command should be 
formatted.  The possibilities are 
@table @code
@item normal
for normal text,
@item code
for text with @samp{---}, @samp{--}, @samp{''} and  @samp{``} kept as is,
@item keep
if the texinfo should be kept as is, without interpretation of the @@-commands.
@end table

For example, we have
@example 
$style_map@{'email'@}->@{'args'@} = ['code', 'normal'];
@end example

because @samp{---}, @samp{--}, @samp{''} and  @samp{``} should be kept as is in
the first argument of @code{@@email}.

The default is @samp{['normal']}.

@item attribute

If the associated value is a word, it is considered to be an @acronym{XML} 
element name, and the argument is enclosed between the element opening
and the element closing. For example, if the value is @code{elem}, the
resulting @acronym{HTML} is @code{<elem>@var{arg}</elem>}.

If the text is a word followed by some text,
the word and is interpreted as above, and the
text is considered to be the attributes text of the element. 
Thus @code{elem class="elem"} leads to 
@code{<elem class="elem">@var{arg}</elem>}.
This works only if there is only one argument. 

@item inline_attribute
Like an attribute, except that it is closed at each paragraph end
and reopened at each beginning of paragraph.  This is in fact more
used than @samp{attribute} since it allows to have well formed
@acronym{HTML}/@acronym{XML}.

@item inline_begin

The associated value is added in front of the text 
and each time a paragraph is restarted while
within the command.

@item inline_end

The associated value is added after the text and each time 
a paragraph is ended while within the command.

@item begin

The associated value is added in front of the text.

@item begin

The associated value is added after the text. 

@item quotes

If the corresponding value is true, the result is 
enclosed in quotes associated with configuration variables
@code{OPEN_QUOTE_SYMBOL} and 
@code{CLOSE_QUOTE_SYMBOL}, with defaults 
@samp{`} and @samp{'} aslo dependent on the output format.

@item function 

The corresponding value should be a function reference. The corresponding
function is called with the following arguments:

@table @code
@item $command
The @@-command name
@item $args
A reference on an array containing the arguments of the @@-command.
@item $command_stack
A reference on an array containing the name of the @@-commands containing 
the @@-command being formatted, latest on top.
@item $state
A reference on a hash containing a lot of informations about the context
of the @@-command.
@item $line_nr
An opaque structure containing the information about the line number of the 
@@-command. It can be used to call @code{main::line_error} or
@code{main::line_warn} with first argument a message, and second argument 
@code{$line_nr}. 
@item $line_numbers
A reference on an array containing the lines numbers (the same opaque 
structure as above)
of the lines spawn by the @@-command.
@end table
@end table

@node Define your own interface
@subsubsection Defining the style and indicatric commands interface

If you don't like this scheme, it is possible to change how those commands
are processed by redefining the following function reference:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $resulting_text style $style $command $text $args $no_close $no_open $line_nr $state $command_stack \@@line_numbers
@var{$command} is the @@-command, @var{$style} is the value associated with 
the @var{$command} in the @code{%style_map}, @code{%style_map_pre} 
or @code{%style_map_texi} hashes.
The @var{$text} is the text appearing within the @@-command braces.
@var{args} is a reference on an array contening the command arguments 
formatted according to the same conventions than with the reference hash style
(provided the value associated with the @@-command is a hash reference with a
@var{$arg} key as described in @ref{Reference hash args}).
If @var{$text} is split in paragraphs each paragraph is passed through
the function, and @var{$no_close} is true if it is not the last paragraph,
while @var{$no_open} is true if it is not the first paragraph.
@var{$line_nr}
is an opaque structure containing the information about the line number of the 
@@-command. It can be used to call @code{main::echo_error} or
@code{main::echo_warning} with first argument a message, and second argument 
@code{$line_nr}.
@var{$state}
is a reference on a hash containing a lot of informations about the context
of the @@-command.
@var{$command_stack}
is a reference on an array containing the name of the @@-commands containing 
the @@-command being formatted.
@var{\@@line_numbers} is a reference on an array containing the lines numbers
of the lines spawn by the @@-command.
@end deftypefn

@node Formatting special simple commands
@subsection Formatting of anchors, images and spaces

The formatting of special simple commands is controlled by functions.  To
customize the output, the corresponding function references should be
redefined. All these functions return a formatted text.

The formatting of anchors is controlled by @code{$anchor_label}.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $anchor_label anchor_label $identifier $anchor
@var{$identifier} is the anchor identifier, @var{$anchor} is the @code{@@anchor}
argument.
@end deftypefn

In the default case, it uses a function reference,  @code{$anchor}
 that can do
a reference target or link. It is especially relevant for @acronym{HTML}
but can be used in other formats, it is a rather common element
of different formats.
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $anchor anchor $identifier $href $text $attributes
If @var{$identifier} is not empty, this value should be used to create
a target for links (typically associated with a name or id 
attribute in @acronym{HTML}).
The @var{$href} argument specifies a hpertextual reference which should be
used to link to a target.
In case both @var{$identifier} and  @var{$href} are given the text produced
should be both a target for @var{$identifier} and a link to @var{$href}.
@var{$text} is the text to be displayed. 
@var{$attributes} are additional attributes.
It should be reasonable to assume that the attributes are for a @code{<a>}
@acronym{HTML} element. 
@end deftypefn

@vindex @@IMAGE_EXTENSIONS
To customize the images produced by @code{@@image}, the first possibility 
is to modify the @code{@@IMAGE_EXTENSIONS} array, which holds a list of 
filename extensions for image files. It is also possible to redefine
the function used to determine the filename of the image:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $filename image_files $basename $extension $texi_base $texi_extension
@var{$basename} is the first @code{@@image} argument, @var{$extension}
is the corresponding @code{@@image} argument, both are formatted.  
Similarly @var{$texi_base} is the first @code{@@image} argument 
without formatting, and @var{$texi_extension} is the extension, unformatted.
This function reference 
should return an array of array references, each array reference holding
a formatted and an unformatted image filenames without path that the main 
program should look for.
@end deftypefn

Last, it is possible to control 
the formatting of @code{@@image} by redefining:
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $image image $file_path $basename $preformatted $file_name $alt_text $width $height $raw_alt $extension $working_dir $file_relative_path $in_paragraph \@@file_locations $base_simple_format $extension_simple_format $file_name_simple_format $line_nr
@var{$file_path} is the image file name with the path from the output directory
to the source manual directory prepended, @var{$basename}  
the file name without extension (the first @code{@@image} argument). 
@var{$preformatted} is true if the image 
appears in preformatted text.  @var{$file_name} is the file name without path 
but with extension. @var{$alt_text} is the alternate text, it may be 
undefined. @var{$width} and @var{$height} are the corresponding arguments 
of @code{@@image}, @var{$raw_alt} is the unmodified alt argument of 
@code{@@image} and @var{$extension} holds the corresponding 
@code{@@image} argument.
@var{$working_dir} is the path to working dir relative to the output
directory. @var{$file_relative_path} is the file name relative to the 
@var{$working_dir}.
@var{$in_paragraph} is true if in paragraphs.
@var{\@@file_locations} is a reference on an array which itself holds a reference on an 
array with 3 elements: the file name array reference as returned by @code{image_files},
the image location if it was found, or undef, and the file name formatted using
a simple formatting in string context.
@var{$base_simple_format} is the @var{$basename} formatted with a simple format.
@var{$extension_simple_format} is the @var{$extension} formatted with a simple format.
@var{$file_name_simple_format} is the @var{$file_name} formatted with a simple format.
@var{$line_nr}
is an opaque structure containing the information about the line number of the 
@@-command. 
@end deftypefn

The formatting of @code{@@sp} is controlled by:
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $sp sp $number $preformatted
@var{$number} is the numeric argument of @code{@@sp}.
@var{$preformatted} is true if the @code{@@sp} appears in preformatted text.
@end deftypefn

The formatting of @code{@@acronym} and @code{@@abbr} is controlled by:
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $acronym acronym_like $acronym_texi $acronym_text $with_explanation \@@explanation_lines $explanation_text $explanation_simply_formatted
@var{$acronym_texi} is the acronym argument with texinfo @@-commands, 
@var{$acronym_text} is formatted. 

The other arguments are related with
the explanation, the second arg of the acronym.  @var{$with_explanation} is 
true if the second argument of the acronym command is present. If an
explanation exists, coming from previous @code{@@acronym} or as an arg of 
this command, the other args are defined: @var{\@@explanation_lines} is a 
reference on an array containing the simply fomatted explanation lines, 
@var{$explanation_text} is the explanation text formatted,
@var{$explanation_simply_formatted} is the explanation formatted in 
a string context, enabling in @acronym{HTML} (or @acronym{XML}) the explanation 
to be in an attribute.
@end deftypefn

@node Formatting characters and text
@subsection Processing special characters in text

Some characters are processed especially in text: @samp{---}, @samp{--},
@samp{``} and @samp{''}. This should only be done only if in normal text and not in 
some commands (@code{@@code}, @code{@@env}@dots{}). A function reference
is called to process the text and should take care of those constructs.
It may also be used to transform the text, for example set it in upper
case if it is in @code{@@sc}. This function should also take care
of protecting special characters.


@deftypefn {Function Reference} $processed_text normal_text $text $in_raw_text $in_preformatted $in_code $in_math $in_simple $command_stack 
The function processes @var{$text} and returns @var{$processed_text}. 
The other arguments give some information about the context of the text.
@var{$in_raw_text} is true if the text appears in special place where
there is no formatting, typically in comments.  @var{$in_preformatted}
is true if in a preformatted environemnt, and @var{$in_code} is true
if in a special command like @code{@@code}, @code{@@env} where
@samp{---}, @samp{--}, @samp{``} and @samp{''} should be left as is.  
@var{$in_math} is true if in @code{@@math}.
@var{$in_simple} is true if in string context with minimal formatting.
 @var{$command_stack} is an array containing the name of the 
formatting @@-command that enclose the text.  

In the default case the @samp{---}, @samp{--}, @samp{``} and @samp{''}
constructs are expanded if needed and the text is upper-cased if in 
@code{@@sc}. Special characters (@samp{&}, @samp{"},
@samp{<} and @samp{>} in @acronym{HTML}) are protected if needed. 
@end deftypefn

Some characters are special, for example we have  @samp{&}, @samp{"}, 
@samp{<} and @samp{>} in @acronym{HTML}. In some cases some
pieces of text don't go through the above function, but still 
needs to be protected to appear in text.
This is done by the function associated with the function reference

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $protected_text protect_text $text
The function processes the unprotected text @var{$text} and returns
the resulting protected text @var{$protected_text}.
@end deftypefn

Empty lines are processed by the following function reference, which could
be usefull if empty lines are to be removed for example

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $resulting_text empty_line $empty_line $state
This function processes an @var{$empty_line} and returns the resulting
text @var{$resulting_text}.  @var{$state} is a structure that holds informations
about the state of the parsing.
Empty lines are left as is by default except right after a definition 
@@-command.
@end deftypefn

@node Formatting of simple line commands
@subsection Customization of simple line command output

@vindex %line_command_map
@@-commands that appear on a line and take the line as argument may
be formatted especially, if they are in the @code{%line_command_map}.
In that case the following function reference is used to format the
@@-command:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $resulting_text line_command $command $arg_text $arg_texi $state
@var{$command} is the @@-command. @var{$arg_text} is the @@-command formatted 
argument, @var{$arg_texi} is the @@-command argument without any formatting.
@var{$state} is a structure that holds informations
about the state of the parsing.
The resulting text is @var{$resulting_text}. 
@end deftypefn

In the default case, @@-commands appearing in @code{@@titlepage}, 
@code{@@title}, @code{@@subtitle}, @code{@@author} are formatted
by this function.

@node Formatting a reference to an external manual
@subsection Formatting a reference to an external manual

The references are produced with two function references, one for the
hypertextual reference construction, the other for the full reference to 
external manual. 

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $href external_href $node $node_identifier $xml_node_identifier $manual_file_name
@var{$node} is the node name, with @@-commands. @var{$node_identifer} is the
node name mapped to an identifier acceptable as a file name. 
@var{$xml_node_identifier} is the
node name mapped to an identifier acceptable as an @acronym{XML} identifier.
Those identifiers are built as explained in @ref{HTML Xref,,,texinfo,GNU Texinfo},
thus allowing for cross references to external manuals.  @var{$file} is the
manual or file name of the external reference.  This function should return an
href leading to the external manual.

In HTML, the default for this function is to make a reference compatible with 
@ref{HTML Xref}.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $text external_ref $command $section $book $file $href $cross_ref_name \@@args_texi \@@formatted_args $node
This function formats a reference to an external Texinfo manual.
The @var{$command} is the reference command (@code{ref}, @code{xref},
@code{pxref} or @code{inforef}).
The optionnal @var{$section} argument is the section in the book and 
@var{book} is the book title.
@var{$node_and_file} is the manual file name.  @var{$href} is an hypertextual
reference to the distant manual constructed using the above function. 
@var{$cross_ref_name} is an optionnal cross
reference name appearing in the reference command. 
@var{\@@args_texi} is a reference on an array containing the @@-command
arguments, not formatted, with @var{\@@formatted_args} contains the formatted
@@-command arguments.  @var{$node} is the node name, formatted.
This function returns
the text corresponding with the external html manual reference.
This function returns the full formatted text of the external reference.
@end deftypefn

@node Formatting a reference within a manual
@subsection Formatting a reference within a manual

A function reference is available for internal references.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $text internal_ref $command $href $short_name $name $is_section \@@args_texi \@@formatted_args \%element
This function formats a reference to a node in the current manual.
The @var{$command} is the ref command (@code{ref}, @code{xref},
@code{pxref} or @code{inforef}).
@var{$href} it an hypertextual reference linking to the corresponding
node or section.  @var{$short_name} and @var{$name} hold the text for the 
reference but @var{$short_name} can be the node name which is assumed to 
be shorter than the section name.
@var{$is_section} is a boolean true if the reference is a reference to a 
sectioning element. 
@var{\@@args_texi} is a reference on an array containing the @@-command
arguments, not formatted, with @var{\@@formatted_args} contains the formatted
@@-command arguments.
@var{\%element} is a reference on a hash holding informations about
the element target of the reference.
This function returns the full formatted text of the internal 
reference.
@end deftypefn

@node Footnotes formatting
@subsection Customizing the footnotes formatting

Each footnote is associated with a footnote entry.  Several footnote entries
are grouped in a footnote section.  When a footnote appears, two things must
be formatted: in the main text the place where the footnote appear
and the footnote text. 

It is possible to replace the footnote with some text before formatting the
footnote. The following function reference, if not undef is used:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $added_text footnote_texi $footnote_text \%state \@@command_stack
@var{$footnote_text} is the footnote text.
@var{\%state} holds informations about the context at the footnote
place in the main document.  For example, 
@code{\%state->@{'outside_document'@}} or @code{\%state->@{'multiple_pass'@}}
could be used.
@var{\@@command_stack} is an array containing the commands enclosing
the footnote.
@end deftypefn



Two functions, with corresponding function references control the formatting
of the footnotes:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} {(\@@lines $text_for_document)} foot_line_and_ref $number_in_doc $number_in_page $footnote_id $place_id $document_file $footnote_file \@@lines \%state
@var{$number_in_doc} is the footnote number in the whole document, 
@var{$number_in_page} is the footnote number in the current page.
@var{$footnote_id} is an identifier for the footnote in the footnote text
which should be used to make target for references to that footnote,
while @var{$place_id} is an identifier for the location of the footnote
in the main document.  Similarly, @var{$document_file} is the file name
of the file containing the text where the footnote appears in the main 
document, while @var{$footnote_file} is the file name of the file where 
the footnote text appears. 

@var{\@@lines} is a reference on an array containing the footnote text
lines, allready formatted.
And @var{\%state} holds informations about the context at the footnote
place in the main document.  As usual the most usefull entry is 
@code{preformatted} which is true if the footnote appears in a preformatted 
context. 

This function returns a reference on an array, @var{\@@lines} containing
the updated footnote text for the footnote entry, and @var{$text_for_document},
the text appearing at the footnote place in the main document, linking
to the footnote entry.
@end deftypefn

The following function is only used when footnotes are at the bottom
of a page and the document is split. 
For customization of the footnotes page in case they are on a separated 
page or section, @ref{Special elements layout}.  The footnotes location 
is determined by @code{footnotestyle}.

@deffn {Function Reference} foot_section \@@footnotes_lines
This function formats a group of footnotes.  @var{\@@footnotes_lines} is a
reference on an array holding the lines of all the footnote entries
formatted as explained above.  This function modifies the reference.

@subsection Formatting of commands centering and flushing text

@vindex %paragraph_style
When a command controlling the alignement of text is used (@code{@@center},

the command.  This function returns a formatted text.
The default is to return the text unmodified.
@end deftypefn

@node Preformatted block command formatting
@subsection Preformatted block command (@code{@@example}, @code{@@display}@dots{}) formatting

Here we see how a whole preformatted block command is 
formatted.  For the formatting
of the text, see @ref{Paragraph and preformatted region}.

@vindex %complex_format_map
The formatting of the block commands is ultimately controlled by a
function, however the default for this function uses a hash and 
changing the hash values should be enough in most cases. This
hash is called @code{%complex_format_map}. It has a key for each
of the preformatted block commands (@code{example}, @code{smallexample}, 
@code{lisp}, @code{smalllisp}, @code{display}, @code{smalldisplay}, 
@code{format}, @code{smallformat}).

The associated value is a reference on a hash.  The keys are:

@table @code
@item begin
The @code{begin} should lead to the beginning of the
formatted output.
@item end
The @code{end} should lead to the end of the 
formatted output.
@item class
The @acronym{HTML} class.  If not defined, the command name.
@item pre_style
The preformatted style. If not defined the corresponding @acronym{CSS} style
is used.
@item style
If the associated value is @code{code}, the format is assumed to be in 
code style, where 
with @samp{---}, @samp{--}, @samp{''} and  @samp{``} kept as is.
If the key is absent the format  inherits the code style
and the font from the enclosing context.
@end table 
The enclosed text will be formatted as described in
@ref{Paragraph and preformatted region}, and the name of the complex
format will be available to the function formatting the text.

If you aren't satisfied with this scheme, you can redefine the following
function reference for a better control over the complex format formatting:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $complex_format_text complex_format $format_name $preformatted_text

@var{$format_name} is the complex format name, @var{$preformatted_text} is the 
text allready formatted as described in @ref{Paragraph and preformatted region}.
This function returns the whole complex format.
@end deftypefn

@node Other block commands formatting
@subsection Formatting of other block commands (@code{@@verbatim}, @code{@@cartouche}, @code{@@quotation}, @code{@@html})

@c FIXME verbatiminclude is distinct
Regions corresponding with raw text, like @code{@@verbatim}, @code{@@html}, 
@code{@@tex} or the content of the file given in @code{@@verbatiminclude} 
argument are formatted according to the following function reference:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $raw_region raw $command $text
@var{$command} is the command name, @var{$text} is the raw text.
In the default case, if @var{$command} is @code{verbatiminclude} 
the text is the content of the @code{@@verbatiminclude} file argument.
@end deftypefn

If La@TeX{}2HTML is used, @code{@@tex} regions are handled differently,
(@pxref{External formatting of commands}).

The @code{@@cartouche} command formatting is controlled by the
function reference:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $cartouche cartouche $text
@var{$text} is the text appearing within the cartouche.
@end deftypefn

The formatting of @code{@@quotation} and @code{@@smallquotation} 
is controlled by two function references.
The first one is usefull in case the @code{@@quotation} has an argument, as
it allows to prepend a string to the quotation text:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $prepended_string quotation_prepend_text $command $text
@var{$command} is the @@-command.
@var{$text} is the argument of the quotation with @@-commands not 
interpreted. This function
can return a string which will be prepended to the quotation text.
@end deftypefn

The whole quotation is formatted by:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $quotation quotation $command $quotation_text $argument_text $argument_text_texi \@@quote_authors
@var{$command} is the @@-command.
@var{$quotation_text} is the quotation text, formatted, with the text 
prepended by the function above.  @var{$argument_text} is the argument 
of the @code{@@quotation}, formatted.  @var{$argument_text_texi} is the argument
of the @code{@@quotation}, simply formatted.
@var{\@@quote_authors} is a reference on an array holding information 
about the @code{@@author} command arguments appearing within the 
@code{@@quotation}.  Each of the array element is a reference on a 
hash with the following keys:
@table @code
@item author_texi
Texinfo code of this @code{@@author} line.
@item author_text
Formatted argument of the @code{@@author} line.
@end table
@end deftypefn

@var{$paragraph_or_preformatted} is @samp{paragraph} when opening a paragraph,
or @samp{preformatted} at the beginning of a preformatted region.
@var{\@@paragraph_at_commands} is a reference on an array containing the
listof th ecommands with brace opened outside of the paragraph or

@node Paragraph and preformatted formatting
@subsection Paragraph and preformatted region formatting

The formatting of a paragraph region or a preformatted region, is controlled
by function references:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $paragraph_text paragraph $text $alignement $index $formatting_command $formatting_command_formatted \$paragraph_number $format $item_number $enumerate_style $number $command_stack_at_end $command_stack_at_begin
This function formats a paragraph.  @var{$text} is the text of the paragraph,
@var{$alignement} is the empty string when no alignement command has
been seen, otherwise it is the current alignement command name.
@xref{Alignement commands formatting}.
@var{$indent} holds @samp{noindent} or @samp{indent} if the corresponding 
@@-command appeared in the paragraph.
@var{$command_stack_at_end} and @var{$command_stack_at_begin} are arrays
containing the opened @@-commands at end and at beginning of the paragraph,
latest on top.

The remaining arguments are usefull when the paragraph appears within a
list or table.  It is usefull whenever the paragraph has to be formatted
differently when appearing in such environments. 
Moreover in that case the format command (@code{@@itemize}@dots{}) 
may have an associated formatting command.
@var{$formatting_command} is this  formatting command
(like @code{@@minus}).
@var{$formatting_command_formatted} is the command formatted in html
in case the formatting command is a leading command (like @code{@@minus})
which should be leading the first paragraph.
@var{\$paragraph_number} is a reference on the number of
paragraphs in that format command.  The corresponding variable should be 
increased when a paragraph is added.  @var{$format} is the format command. 
@xref{Table and list items formatting}.

If the @var{$format} is an enumerate, @var{$item_number} is the number of 
the item in the list, @var{$enumerate_style} is the argument of the enumerate,
@var{$number} is the number or letter corresponding with this item. 
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $preformatted_text preformatted $text $style $region_name $formatting_command $formatting_command_formatted \$preformatted_number $format $item_number $enumerate_style $number $command_stack_at_end $command_stack_at_begin
This function formats a preformatted region.  @var{$text} is the text of the
preformatted region, @var{$style} is the css style associated with that
preformatted region (@pxref{Customizing CSS}).  @var{$region_name} is the 
name of the command opening        
the preformatted region (@code{example}@dots{}, see @ref{Preformatted block command formatting}) 
or a identifier for the preformatted context (for example 
@code{menu-comment}, see @ref{Menu formatting}).
The alignment commands are not taken into account, as the spaces are
preserved in preformatted regions, you should flush and center by hand.
@var{$command_stack_at_end} and @var{$command_stack_at_begin} are arrays
containing the opened @@-commands at end and at beginning of the preformatted
region, latest on top.

The remaining arguments are usefull when the preformatted region appears 
within a list or table.  It is usefull whenever the preformatted region 
has to be formatted
differently when appearing in such environments. 
Moreover in that case the format command (@code{@@itemize}@dots{}) 
may have
an associated formatting command.
@var{$formatting_command} is this formatting command
(like @code{@@minus}).
@var{$formatting_command_formatted} is the command formatted in html
in case the formatting command is a leading command (like @code{@@minus})
which should be leading the first preformatted region.
@var{\$preformatted_number} is a reference on the number of
preformatted regions in that format command.  The corresponding variable 
should be increased when a preformatted region is added. @var{$format} is the 
format command.
@xref{Table and list items formatting}.

If the @var{$format} is an enumerate, @var{$item_number} is the number of 
the item in the list, @var{$enumerate_style} is the argument of the enumerate,
@var{$number} is the number or letter corresponding with this item. 
@end deftypefn

A special function reference is called instead if the preformatted
is empty and the function reference is defined:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $preformatted_text empty_preformatted $text
@var{$text} is the text of th epreformatted which should contain only
spaces.  The function refernece should return the formatted text for 
this empty preformatted region.
@end deftypefn

@node Avoiding paragraphs
@subsection Avoiding paragraphs in @@-commands

@cindex Avoid paragraph opening

@vindex %format_in_paragraph
It is possible to avoid that a format closes the previous paragraph or
preformatted region and reopens one, by putting the format command in a 
hash, @code{%format_in_paragraph} with a true value.  This only 
makes sense for few commands since otherwise the nesting of formats and
paragraphs could become wrong.

@vindex %no_paragraph_commands
If the value of @code{%no_paragraph_commands} associated with a command is
true, no paragraph is started by the command if outside of a paragraph
(after an empty line, for example).  If the value is set to 0, it will start
a paragraph.  If the value is not set, reasonable defaults are
set.

@vindex %stop_paragraph_command
It is also possible to stop a paragraph when an @@-command happens by
putting the @@-command in the @code{%stop_paragraph_command} hash
associated with a true value.

@node Lists and tables formatting
@subsection Customizing the formatting of lists and tables

The formatting of lists and tables is done at two levels:
@itemize
@item 
At the level of the whole region (table or list),
@item
At the level of the individual items, rows or cells of the list or table.
@end itemize

@menu

@end menu


@node Table and list items formatting
@subsubsection Formatting individual table and list items

In texinfo it is possible to give @code{@@itemize} or table command (hereafter
called a @dfn{format command}) a @dfn{formatting command}. 
For example @code{@@minus} is the formatting command here:
@example
@@table @@minus
@end example

@vindex %special_list_commands
The default is to apply the command to the text item, however it is possible
to avoid it.
The hash @code{%special_list_commands} has an entry for each of the 
format command.  Each of these entries is a hash reference.  If a formatting
command is a key of the hash reference, then the formatting command is not
applied to the text item for that format command.  For example, if we have:

@example
$special_list_commands@{'itemize'@} = @{ 'bullet' => '' @};
@end example

and we have the following @code{@@itemize}:
@example
@@itemize @@bullet
@@item an item
@@end itemize
@end example

then @code{@@bullet} will not be applied to @code{an item}.

Every time a @code{@@tab} or an @code{@@item} is encountered, the following 
function reference is called, if defined:
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $result_line tab_item_texi $command \@@command_stack \@@stack \%state $line $line_nr
@var{$command} is the command name.
@var{\@@command_stack} is an array with all the @@-commands opened, latest
on top.
@var{\@@stack} is an opaque variable.
@var{\%state} holds informations about the current context. 
@var{$line} is the line appearing after the command.
@var{$line_nr}
is an opaque structure containing the information about the line number of the 
@@-command. 
The function returns the line that may be further processed.
@end deftypefn


More control of the text before formatting of the line or the item is 
achieved with the following function reference:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} ($result_line, $open_command) format_list_item_texi $format $line $prepended $command $number
The @var{$format} is the list or table @@-command, 
@var{$line} is the item line, @var{$command} is the @dfn{format command},
@var{$prepended} is set to the text folllowing the @dfn{format command}
on the format argument line.
The @var{$number} is the number of the item, as set in @code{@@enumerate}.
The @var{$result_line} replaces the item argument.
@var{$open_command} is an obsolete return code that can be set to 
anything.
@end deftypefn

Then the different @@-commands items are formatted thanks to
function references:

@table @strong
@item lists
The items of lists are formatted using the following function reference:
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $list_item list_item $text $format $command $formatted_command $item_number $enumerate_style $number $prepended_texi $prepended_formatted $only_inter_item_commands $before_items $item_command
This function formats the text between @code{@@item} commands.  @var{$text} 
is the text corresponding with the item.  @var{$format} is the type of format,
@samp{itemize} or @samp{enumerate}.  @var{$command} is the formatting command
given in argument to @code{@@itemize}, @var{$formatted_command} is this command
formatted if it is a leading command, like @code{@@minus}.

If the @var{$format} is an enumerate, @var{$item_number} is the number of 
the item in the list, @var{$enumerate_style} is the argument of the enumerate,
@var{$number} is the number or letter corresponding with this item. 

If the @var{$format} is an itemize, @var{$prepended_texi} is the text that
appeared on the itemize line, maybe after the formatting command
(if any), and @var{$prepended_formatted} is the corresponding text, 
formatted.

@var{$only_inter_item_commands} is true if there are only @@-commands 
that are not considered as the item argument in the item, like
index entries.
@var{$before_items} is set if there is in fact no leading @code{@@item}
for the text, as it may happen for some text following the @var{$format} 
@@-command, as in 

@example
@@table @@asis
Tex before items.

@end example
@var{$item_command} is the item command name.

@end deftypefn

@item two column tables
The two columns tables (@code{@@table}, @code{@@ftable} and @code{@@vtable}), 
items are formatted using two function references,
one for the first line located on the @code{@@item} line corresponding
with the first column, the other for the text appearing on the
following lines, corresponding with the second column text.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $table_item table_item $item_text $index_label_text $format $command \@@command_stack $item_command $formatted_index_entry
This function is used to format the text on the @code{@@item} line.
@var{$item_text} is the text line.  In case there is an index entry 
associated with the @code{@@item} (as with @code{@@ftable} and 
@code{@@vtable}), @var{$index_label_text} is the text inserted at 
the place where an index entry appears.  @xref{Index entry place formatting}.
@var{$format} is the type of format,
@samp{table}, @samp{ftable} or @samp{vtable}.  @var{$command} is the formatting command
given in argument to the table format command.
@var{\@@command_stack} is an array with all the @@-commands opened, latest
on top.
@var{$item_command} is the item command, @samp{@@item} or @samp{@@itemx}.
@var{$formatted_index_entry} is the index entry formatted.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $table_line table_line $text
This function is used to format the text on the lines following
the @code{@@item} line. @var{$text} is the corresponding text. 
@end deftypefn

@item multitable
@anchor{Multitable formatting}
The multitable elements formatting is controlled by the functions associated
with two function references.  One for a cell, and the other for a row.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $multitable_cell cell $text $item_command \@@columnfractions \@@prototype_row \@@prototype_lengths $column_number
This function is used to format the text of a multitable cell, the text 
following a @code{@@item} or a @code{@@tab}.
@var{$text} is the corresponding text. @var{$item_command} is the command 
used to introduce the row, such that it is possible to distinguish 
between @code{@@item} and @code{@@headitem}.
@var{\@@columnfractions} is a reference on an array 
containing the @code{@@columnfraction} arguments, if any, and 
@var{\@@prototype_row} is a reference on an array containing the row prototypes
given on the @code{@@multitable} line, if any.
@var{\@@prototype_lengths} array contains the lengths of the row prototypes
formatted.
@var{$column_number} is the maximal number of columns.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $multitable_row row $text $item_command \@@columnfractions \@@prototype_row \@@prototype_lengths $column_number
This function is used to format a multitable row. @var{$text} is
the row text, with cells allready formatted with the @code{$cell}
function reference. @var{$item_command}, @var{\@@columnfractions}, 
@var{\@@prototype_row}, @var{\@@prototype_lengths}
and @var{$column_number} are the same than in the function reference above.

@end deftypefn
@end table

In the default case, this function is interlinked with 
@code{$begin_format_texi} (@pxref{Customizing generalized block command opening})
and @code{@@multitable} formatting
since a stack of possible nested 
multitables is kept to know the cell number.


@node Whole table and list formatting
@subsubsection Formatting of a whole table or list

@vindex %format_map
If the Texinfo command is a key of the @code{%format_map}, the associated
value is used to specify the formatting of the construct, otherwise a function 
is called. 
The value in @code{%format_map} associated with a command is interpreted 
similarly with values associated with more simpler commands:

@itemize
@item
If the text is a word, in HTML or XML, it is considered to be an XML
or HTML element
name, and the whole table or list is enclosed between the element opening
and the element closing.
@item
If the text is a word followed by some text, 
the word and is interpreted as above, and the
text is considered to be the attributes text of the element. 
@item
If the text is empty nothing is added to the text.
@end itemize

In case the @code{%format_map} isn't used, a function reference called
@code{$table_list}
should be redefined, the associated function will be called each time
a command isn't found in @code{%format_map}.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $whole_table_list table_list $format_command $text $command $formatted_command $item_nr $enumerate_style $prepended_texi $prepended_formatted \@@columnfractions \@@prototype_row \@@prototype_lengths $column_number
@var{$format_command} is the Texinfo command name, @var{$text} is the 
formatted items. @var{$command} is the @dfn{format command} given in argument
to the format command, @var{$formatted_command} is the same, but formatted.
@var{$prepended_texi} is the remaining text on the format command line,
@var{$prepended_formatted} is the same, but formatted.
Only relevant in @code{@@enumerate}, @var{$item_nr} is the item number, and 
@var{$enumerate_style} is the @code{@@enumerate} style.  Only relevant in 
@code{@@multitable}
@var{\@@columnfractions} is a reference on an array 
containing the @code{@@columnfraction} arguments, if any, 
@var{\@@prototype_row} is a reference on an array containing the row prototypes
given on the @code{@@multitable} line, if any,
@var{\@@prototype_lengths} array contains the lengths of the row prototypes
formatted and
@var{$column_number} is the maximal number of columns.
@end deftypefn

If you still want to use @code{%format_map} but differently from 
the default, it is possible to redefine the following function reference:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $whole_table_list format $command $format $text
@var{$command} is the @@-command, @var{$format} is the entry associated with
@var{$command} in @code{%format_map}.  @var{$text} is the formatted items.
@end deftypefn


@node Definition formatting
@subsection Interpretation and formatting of the definition formatting

The formatting of definition commands is controlled by a main hash,
3 strings and another hash, and and five
functions.  The main hash describes how the text on the definition line is 
interpreted, the functions control the formatting of the definition line
and the definition function text.

@menu
* Definition line interpretation::
* Definition command formatting::
@end menu


@node Definition line interpretation
@subsubsection Customizing the interpretation of a definition line

@vindex %def_map
The keys of the hash @code{%def_map} are definition command names.
There are two types of entries:

@itemize

@item If the command is a shortcut for 
another definition command the value is a text and the definition 
command is replaced by the text.

For example if we have:
@example
$def_map@{'deftruc'@} = '@@defvr @{A truc@}';
@end example

and a line like
@example 
@@deftruc var
@end example

the line will be transformed in
@example
@@defvr @{A truc@} var
@end example

@item
If the command is not a shortcut, it is associated with an array
reference.  The first element is @samp{f}, @samp{v} or @samp{t} corresponding
with the index type (@samp{f} for function, @samp{v} for variable,
@samp{t} for type).

The remaining of the array describes how to interpret the text following
the definition command on the definition command line. 
The entry item specify what corresponds
with the next bracketed item or word.  Currently the possibilities are
@samp{category}, @samp{name}, @samp{type}, @samp{class}, @samp{arg} 
and @samp{argtype}.  @samp{arg} means that the arguments are not mixed 
with type definitions, with @samp{argtype} types are mixed with 
definitions. When there is no @samp{arg} nor @samp{argtype} it is 
the same than @samp{argtype}.

For example if we have
@example
def_map@{'defvr'@} = [ 'v', 'category', 'name' ];
@end example

The first bracketed item following @code{@@defvr} is considered
to be the category and the next one is the name.  The index associated
with the definition line is the variables index.
@end itemize

Some characters are special with regard with definition parsing, they
are delimiters, the can have a role in definition argument determination, 
and also hae a special meaning in arguments parsing. 
This is not very well documented in the Texinfo manual,
so it is subject to change.  Strings allow to determine the delimiters:

@vtable @code
@item $def_argument_separator_delimiters
Characters that separate arguments, currently @code{()[],}.
@item $def_always_delimiters
Character that are always delimiters, if they appear in a type or a 
parameter,
@code{()[]}.
@item $def_in_type_delimiters
Character that are considered as delimiters only if in a type. In
a parameter they are part of the parameter.
@end vtable


@node Definition command formatting
@subsubsection Customization of the definition formatting

Five functions are used when formatting a definition command:

@table @strong
@item category name
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $category definition_category $category $class $style $command
This function precise a category name associating a class 
@var{$class} (if given) with @var{$category}.  The @var{$style} of the
definition may be @samp{f}, for function, @samp{v}, for variable or @samp{t}, 
for type.  The @var{$command} is the definition @@-command.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $entry definition_index_entry $name $class $style $command
This function precise a name associating a class 
@var{$class} (if given) with @var{$name}.  This is used to do an index
entry associated with th edefinition command.  The @var{$style} of the
definition may be @samp{f}, for function, @samp{v}, for variable or @samp{t}, 
for type.  The @var{$command} is the definition @@-command.
@end deftypefn

@item formatting of the definition line
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $line def_line $class_category_class $name $type $arguments $index_label \@@arguments_array \@@arguments_type_array \@@unformatted_arguments_array $command $class_name $category $class $style $original_command
This function formats the definition line.  @var{$class_category} is the 
category
formatted with @code{$definition_category}, @var{$name}, @var{$type} and 
@var{arguments} are the element of the definition line.  @var{$index_label} is
the text inserted at the place where an index entry appears. 
@xref{Index entry place formatting}.
@var{\@@arguments_array} is an array holding the definition arguments, 
formatted. @var{\@@arguments_type_array} holds the type of the definition
arguments, like @samp{name}, @samp{type} and similar arguments, 
@samp{paramtype}.
@samp{delimiter} and  @samp{param}.  @var{\@@unformatted_arguments_array} 
holds the arguments without @@-command substitution. @var{$command} is the
definition command, after substitution. 
@var{$class_name} is the class applied on name, formatted
as specified in @code{definition_index_entry}.  @var{$category} and 
@var{$class} are the corresponding arguments.  @var{$style} corresponds 
with the index style, as explained above.  @var{$original_command} is the 
unmodified definition @@-command.
@end deftypefn

@item definition text
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $definition_text def_item $text $only_inter_item_commands $command
This function formats the definition text, @var{$text}.
@var{$only_inter_item_commands} is true if there are only @@-commands 
that are not considered as the definition argument in the definition
text, like index entries.
@var{$command} is the definition @@-command.
@end deftypefn

@item the whole definition
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $definition def $text $command
This function formats the whole definition.  The definition line and text 
formatted by the above functions are in @var{$text}.
@var{$command} is the definition @@-command.

@node Menu formatting
@subsection Menu formatting

There are two possibilities for menu formatting:

@itemize @bullet
@item format the whole menu in a preformatted environment, like 
in @ref{Preformatted block command formatting};
@item format the menu in table with more specialized formatting for each
part of the menu; 
@end itemize

The simple formatting in a preformatted is used if 
the configuration variable @code{SIMPLE_MENU} is true, 
otherwise the format with tables is used (this is the default).

In HTML, if the configuration variable @code{USE_ACCESSKEY} is set, 
the @code{accesskey} attribute is used in anchors.  In that case the 
@code{%BUTTONS_ACCESSKEY} hash is used for the access key.

In @command{texi2any}, a menu is considered to be composed of 2 parts, the
@dfn{menu entries} and the @dfn{menu comments} (@pxref{Writing a Menu}).
Menu entries are further 
divided in an @dfn{entry link} and optionnaly an @dfn{entry description}.
The entry link consists in a node name and an optional menu entry
name (@pxref{Menu Parts}).

@node Menu components formatting
@subsubsection The formatting of the different menu components

If in a preformatted context (and @code{SIMPLE_MENU} isn't set), the 
menu link and description are put in the same preformatted environment.
This can be avoided with the configuration variable 
@code{SEPARATE_DESCRIPTION}.

Two function references are associated with the formatting of the 
different parts of a menu:
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $link menu_link $section \%state $href $node $name $ending $has_name \@@command_stack $preformatted $node_normalized_formatted
@var{$section} is the section name corresponding with the link, @var{$href}
is the link hypertextual reference. @var{$href} may be absent.  
@var{\%state} holds informations about the current context. 
@var{$node} is the node name, @var{$name} is the
name of the node.  @var{$ending} is the text ending the link entry, 
in general @samp{::} followed by some spaces.
@var{$has_name} is true if the entry has an explicit name, otherwise
@var{$name} has been constructed using the formatted node name.
@var{\@@command_stack} is an array containing the commands enclosing
the menu link.  It is used in the default case to detect if the 
menu link is right in the @command{@@menu} or not, since if it is not 
right below the menu the formatting is simpler.
@var{$preformatted} is true if in preformatted context.
@xref{Four contexts}. 
@var{$node_normalized_formatted} is the node with spaces normalized
and formatted.
@end deftypefn

This command is not called if @code{SIMPLE_MENU} is set.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $description menu_description $description_text \%state $element_text
@var{$description_text} is the text of the menu description. 
The formatted link is also here if in preformatted context and 
@code{SEPARATE_DESCRIPTION} is not set.
@var{\%state}
should be used similarly than for the menu link.  @var{$element_text}
is the heading of the element associated with the node.
@var{$command_stack} and @var{$preformatted} are the same than for the
menu link.
@end deftypefn

The @dfn{menu comment} part is formatted like a normal command, 
called @code{menu_comment}.  It is only used if not in preformatted 
environment.
The default is to have it be formatted
like a @ref{Preformatted block command formatting}, with
@example
$complex_format_map@{'menu_comment'@} =
@{
   'begin' => "<tr><th colspan=\"3\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">",
   'end' => "</th></tr>", 'class' => 'menu-comment',
@}
@end example


@node Simple menu formatting
@subsubsection  Simple menu formatting in a preformatted environment

If the menu is to be formatted in a single preformatted environment,
an entry for @samp{menu} and @samp{detailmenu} 
should be added to the @code{%complex_format_map}
hash (@pxref{Preformatted block command formatting}).
In the default case, if the user didn't add an entry himself, a very simple 
entry is used, with:

@example
$complex_format_map->@{'menu'@} = @{ 'begin' => '' , 'end' => '',
    'class' => 'menu-preformatted' @};
@end example


@node Table menu formatting
@subsubsection The formatting of the menu in a table

In the default case, the name of the section corresponding with the 
node is used instead of the node name.  If the configuration 
variable @code{NODE_NAME_IN_MENU} is 
true, however, node names are used.  If the configuration variable 
@code{AVOID_MENU_REDUNDANCY}
is true and menu entry equal menu description the description is not printed.
This is the default.  Likewise, if node or section name equal entry name, 
do not print entry name.

@vindex $MENU_SYMBOL
@vindex $UNNUMBERED_SYMBOL_IN_MENU
A symbol, @code{$MENU_SYMBOL} is put at the beginning of menu entries
when the node name is used. The default is @samp{&bull;} for HTML, @samp{*}
for text formats.
If @code{$UNNUMBERED_SYMBOL_IN_MENU} is true it is 
also put at the beginning of unnumbered section names (in HTML).  This is not
done by default.

@vindex $MENU_PRE_STYLE
@vindex $MENU_PRE_COMPLEX_FORMAT
The menu comments are considered to be preformatted text.  The style 
associated with this preformatted text is determined by 
@code{$MENU_PRE_STYLE}. Default is @samp{font-family: serif}.
The entry similar with an entry in @code{%complex_format_map} 
(@pxref{Preformatted block command formatting}) used when the menu 
appears in a preformatted
enviroment is in
@code{$MENU_PRE_COMPLEX_FORMAT}, and, in the default case is:
@example
$MENU_PRE_COMPLEX_FORMAT = @{
              'pre_style' => $MENU_PRE_STYLE, 
              'class' => 'menu-preformatted'
   @};
@end example

The CSS class associated with menu comments is @code{menu-comments}.

The following function reference controls the formatting of a wole menu
or a detailmenu in that case:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $menu menu_command $command $menu_components_text
@var{$command} is the menu command, currently @samp{menu}, @samp{detailmenu}
or @samp{direntry}.
@var{$menu_components_text} is the formatted menu components text, obtained
as explained above.
@end deftypefn


@node Indices formatting
@subsection Indices formatting

Two different things needs to be handled for indices formatting, the place
where the index term appears, the index entry, and the index list itself.
The indexing commands like @code{@@cindex} determines where index entries
appear, and the index list is printed with a @code{@@printindex} command. 

@menu
* Index entry place formatting::   Index entries in the main document are 
                                   targets for hypertext references
* Index list formatting::          Customizing the formatting of the index list
@end menu


@node Index entry place formatting
@subsubsection Formatting of index entries

Index entry places in the main text may be the target for
references.  Their formatting
is controlled by the function associated with the following function 
reference:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $target index_entry_label $identifier $preformatted $entry $index_name $index_command $texi_entry $formatted_entry $in_region_not_in_output \%index_entry
@var{$identifier} should be used to create
a target for links (typically associated with a name or id 
attribute in @acronym{HTML}).
@var{$preformatted} is true if the index entry appeared in preformatted text.
@var{$entry} is the index entry with all the @@-commands removed.
@var{$index_name} is the index name, @var{$command} is the index command which
may be a index command like @code{@@cindex}, but also a definition or 
a table.  @var{$texi_entry} is the index entry with @@-commands, and 
@var{$formatted_entry} the entry formatted.
@var{$in_region_not_in_output} is set if the index entry appears in a region
formatting (for example @code{@@titlepage}) and not in the
output document.
@var{\%index_entry} is a reference on a hash holding informations about
the index entry.
@end deftypefn

Regular index entries are (like @code{@@cindex}) are 
formatted using the following function reference:
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $index_entry index_entry_command $command $index_name $label $entry_texi $entry_formatted
@var{$command}, @var{$index_name}, @var{$entry_texi} and @var{$entry_formatted}
are the same as above, and @var{$label} is what could be used as a label,
formatted using the function above. 
@end deftypefn


@node Index list formatting
@subsubsection Customizing the formatting of index lists

There is an elaborate default index formatting, with
index summary by letter linking to index entries grouped by letters too,
with the possibility of index pages split accross files. This system may be 
completly bypassed by redefining the function reference that is called when
@code{@@printindex} is encountered:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $index_text printindex $index_name \%printindex
@var{$index_name} is the index name appearing on the 
@code{@@printindex} line. 
@var{\%printindex} is a reference on a hash holding informations
on the index.
The index formatted should be returned by this function reference.
@end deftypefn

If the default index formatting is used, there are still possibilities
to customize part of the formatting.
The index entries are sorted alphabetically.  A whole index list is 
considered to be composed of letter entries.  A letter entry is composed
by all the index entries beginning with that letter.  A letter may
be a non alphabetical character, but we call it letter here.

An index summary appears at the beginning and at the end of an index list,
and should be used to jump directly to a letter entry.  Indices lists
may be split across pages, thus the different letters may appear on different
files.  The number of index entries appearing on each page is determined
by a configuration variable @code{SPLIT_INDEX}, if set. The default is not 
to split indices.

The formatting of all these elements is controlled by the following
function references:

@table @emph
@item formatting of a letter in a summary
@deftypefn {Function Reference} {($result_letter, $identifier, $is_symbol)} summary_letter $letter $file $identifier $index_element_id $number $index_element $index_name
This function is used to format a letter appearing in a summary, refering
to a letter entry in the index list.
@var{$letter} is the letter.  @var{$file} is the file name where the letter
entry appears.  More precisely, it is empty when the letter entry is on the 
same page than the summary, it contains the file name when the index page
is split accross page.  @var{$identifier} is an identifier for the target 
letter entry.  @var{$index_element_id} is the identifier associated with the
element holding the letter.  @var{$number} and @var{$index_element} are 
not specified.  @var{$index_name} is the name of the index.
The function returns the resulting letter @var{$result_letter}, an
identifier for the letter @var{$identifier}, to be used in anchors, for example
and @code{$is_symbol} should be true if the letter is not a regular letter
but a symbol.
@end deftypefn

@item formatting of a summary
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $summary index_summary \@@alphabetical_letters \@@nonalphabetical_letters
@var{\@@alphabetical_letters} and @var{\@@nonalphabetical_letters} contain the
formatted summary letters, formatted with the above function.
@end deftypefn

@item formatting of an index entry
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $entry index_entry $entry_href $entry_text $element_href $element_heading $entry_file $element_file $entry_target $entry_element_target $in_region_not_in_output \%index_entry
@var{$entry_href} is a reference to the place where the index entry 
appeared, @var{$entry_text} is the corresponding text.  @var{$element_href}
is a reference to the beginning of the element containing 
the index entry, @var{$element_heading} is the heading of the element.
@var{$entry_file} is the file where the index entry appear, while 
@var{$element_file} is the file of the element.  @var{$entry_target} is the
target of the index entry, @var{$entry_element_target} is the
element target.
@var{$in_region_not_in_output} is set if the index entry appears in a region
formatting (for example @code{@@titlepage}) and not in the
output document.
@var{\%index_entry} is a reference on a hash holding informations about
the index entry.
@end deftypefn

@item formatting of letter entry
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $letter_entry index_letter $letter $identifier $index_entries_text
This function formats a letter entry, consisting in all the index entries 
beginning with this letter.  @var{$letter} is the letter, @var{$identifier} 
should be used to create a target for links (typically links from summaries),
and @var{$index_entries_text} is the text of the index entries formatted as 
described above.
@end deftypefn

@item formatting of whole index
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $index print_index $index_text $index_name
@var{$index_text} is the text of all the index entries grouped by letter
appearing in that page formatted as above.  It is undef if there are
no entries or theindex name isn't known. @var{index_name} is the name of
the index, the argument of @code{@@printindex}.
@end deftypefn
@end table


@node Floats and lists of floats formatting
@subsection Floats and lists of floats

Floats appear in the @code{@@float} environment, optionaly with a style
and a label, and with optionnal @code{@@caption} and @code{@@shortcaption}. 
Their list appear after a @code{@@listoffloats}. 

A hash reference is associated with each float, it is available in some
formatting functions.  The keys are:
@table @code
@item caption_texi
@itemx shortcaption_texi
A reference on an array containing the caption or shortcaption lines,
with texi @@-commands.
@item style_texi
The style with texi @@-commands.
@item style_id
The unique identifier associated with the style.
@item style
The style formatted.
@item nr
The number with the same conventions than makeinfo (use the chapter number a 
dot and then the number of the float of that style in the chapter, or an
absolute number if in unnumbered).
@item chapter_nr
The number of the chapter containing the float.
@item nr_in_chapter
The number of the float in the chapter.
@item absolut_nr
The number of the float in the document.
@item texi
The label with @@-commands.
@item name
The label formatted.
@item id
The unique identifier associated with the label.  Usefull to make an anchor
or a reference.
@item target
The target that can be used to refer to that float.
@item element
A reference on a structure representing the element the float appear in.

@node Float formatting
@subsubsection Formatting a float

First there is an occasion to construct a texinfo text for the caption, using
the caption texinfo lines and the informations in the float structure.
The returned lines will be formatted in the main program.  A function reference
is used here:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} {(\@@caption_lines_returned, \@@shortcaption_lines_returned)} caption_shortcaption \%float \@@caption_lines \@@shortcaption_lines
@var{\%float} is the structure defined above.  @var{\@@caption_lines} and 
@var{\@@shortcaption_lines} are references on arrays containing the 
texinfo lines for caption and short caption.  @var{\@@caption_lines_returned}
and @var{\@@shortcaption_lines_returned} are references on an array 
containing the texinfo lines for the caption and shortcaption.
@end deftypefn

Then the float is formatted with the following function reference:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $text float $float_text \%float $caption_text $shortcaption_text
@var{$float_text} is the text appearing within the @code{@@float}, formatted.
@var{\%float} is still the structure defined above.  @var{$caption_text} and
@var{$shortcaption_text} are the caption and short caption build with the
above function and formatted.
@end deftypefn

It is also possible to do something when a caption or a shortcaption appear
with the following function reference:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $text caption_shortcaption_command $command $formatted_caption \@@texi_lines \%float
@var{$command} is the @@-command, @samp{caption} or @samp{shortcaption}.
@var{$formatted_caption} is the caption text, formatted, while 
@var{\@@texi_lines} is a reference on an array containing the caption lines,
this time without any formatting.
@var{\%float} is still the structure defined above. 

In the default case this function reference returns an empty string.
@end deftypefn


@node List of floats formatting
@subsubsection Formatting lists of floats

A list of floats is introduced by @code{@@listoffloats}.  The argument of
@code{@@listoffloats} is the @dfn{style}.  First the style texinfo can be 
modified with the following function reference:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $style_texi_returned listoffloats_style $style_texi
@var{$style_texi} is the @code{@@listoffloats} argument with texinfo 
@@-commands kept.  It is possible to make changes to the @var{$style_texi} and
return a modified string, still with @@-commands.  The modified string
is formatted in the main program.
@end deftypefn

After that, for each of the floats with that style, first there is a 
possibility to modify the float style and the float caption before they 
are formatted in the main program, with the following function references:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $float_style_texi_returned listoffloats_float_style $style_texi \%float
@var{$style_texi} is the style, and @var{\%float} is the structure described 
above.  This function reference returns a style to be formatted in the
main program.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {Function Reference} (\@@caption_texi_returned, $caption_or_shortcaption) listoffloats_caption \%float
@var{\%float} is the structure described 
above.  This function reference returns a caption to be formatted in the
main program, @var{\@@caption_texi_returned}, and a string, 
@var{$caption_or_shortcaption} that is either @samp{caption} or 
@samp{shortcaption} that can be used by the main program if this information
is needed. 
@end deftypefn

Each entry is formatted by:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $listoffloats_entry listoffloats_entry $style_texi \%float $float_style $caption $href
@var{$style_texi} is the style with @@-commands, @var{$float_style} is the
style returned by the above function and formatted. @var{$caption} is the
caption returned by the above function formatted. @var{\%float} is the 
structure corresponding with the float, and @var{$href} is an href pointing to
the float location.
@end deftypefn

Lastly, the whole @code{@@listoffloats} is formatted by:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $listoffloats listoffloats $style_texi $style \@@listoffloats_entries
@var{$style_texi} is the style with @@-commands, @var{$style} is the
style returned by the above function and formatted. The array reference 
@var{\@@listoffloats_entries} holds the entries formatted by the above
function.
@end deftypefn

@node Handling special regions
@section Handling special regions

@vindex %region_formats_kept
Special regions @code{@@titlepage}, @code{@@documentdescription} and
@code{@@copying} are removed from the document before the last pass in the
default case. They can be kept if the value associated with the @@-command
in the @code{%region_formats_kept} hash is true.

The following function reference is called when starting the
formatting of a special region, if defined:

@deffn {Function Reference} begin_special_region $region_name \%state \@@region_lines
@var{$region_name} is the region name.
@var{\%state} holds informations about the context of the region formatting. 
@var{\@@region_lines} holds the region lines.
@end deffn

The following function reference is called when ending the formatting 
of the special region, if defined:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} $formatting_result end_special_region $region_name \%state $formatted_region
@var{$region_name} is the region name.
@var{\%state} holds informations about the context of the region formatting. 
@var{$formatted_region} is the result of the region formatting.
The function reference returns the result of the region formatting, after
possibly modifying it.
@end deftypefn

The @code{@@insertcopying} @@-command is formatted by 
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $insertcopying insertcopying $text $comment $simple_text
@var{$text} is the text appearing in @code{@@copying}, formatted.
@var{$comment} is the text with texi removed, should be very simple
text. 
@var{$simple_text} is the text formatted in string context
with minimal formatting but no elements.
@end deftypefn

The copying commane that is to be used at the beginning of output
files is formatted by
@deftypefn {Function Reference} $copying_comment_formatted copying_coment \@@copying_lines $text $comment $simple_text
@var{\@@copying_lines} is an array containing the Texinfo lines in @code{@@copying}.
@var{$text} is the text appearing in @code{@@copying}, formatted.
@var{$comment} is the text with texi removed, should be very simple
text.
@var{$simple_text} is the text formatted in string context
with minimal formatting but no elements.
@end deftypefn

@code{@@documentdescription} is handled by the following function
reference, that should set the configuration variable @code{documentdescription}:

@deffn {Function Reference} documentdescription \@@documentdescription_lines $text $comment $simple_text
@var{\@@documentdescription_lines} is an array containing the Texinfo lines in @code{@@documentdescription}.
@var{$text} is the text appearing in @code{@@documentdescription}, formatted.
@var{$comment} is the text with texi removed, should be very simple
text.
@var{$simple_text} is the text formatted in string context
with minimal formatting but no elements.
@end deffn


The title page handling is described in @ref{Title page text}.

@node Other and unknown commands
@section Customizing other commands, and unknown commands 

@cindex skipped command
@cindex unknown command

Many commands without braces are available in Texinfo, sometimes with
a specific syntax. For example we have @code{@@sp}, @code{@@noindent},
@code{@@documentlanguage}, @code{@@oddheading}, @code{@@headings},
@code{@@shortcontents}, @code{@@shorttitlepage} or @code{@@comment}. 
@command{texi2any} interprets
some of these commands and some functions or variables are used for
their formatting or to access their information.
In the default case, however, most of these constructs are ignored.

It is possible to change how the things following these commands
on the line are handled, what is considered to be an arg for those
commands and it is also possible to keep them instead of discarding
them such that it is possible to handle them specially, with the
same function than the one used for unknown commands.

@vindex %misc_command
Those special commands without braces are the key of a hash:
@code{%misc_command}.  The associated value is a reference on a
hash enabling to set the properties of these commands.  The
keys of this hash reference is the name of a property, the value
is the value of the property. For example here we have @code{line}
for the @code{arg} property for the @code{command} @@-command.

@example
$misc_command@{'command'@} = @{'arg' => 'line', 'skip' => 'space'@};
@end example

The properties and possible values are:

@table @code
@item skip
This property enables to set what is skipped after the command arguments.
Here are the possible values:
@table @code
@item line
The remaining of the line is skipped.
@item space 
Spaces are skipped but not newline.
@item whitespace 
Spaces are skipped
@item linewhitespace
Spaces are skipped if there are only spaces remaining on the line.
@item linespace
Spaces are skipped, but not newline if
there are only spaces remaining on the line
@end table

@item arg
If the associated value is @code{line} the line is considered to be the
argument.  If it is a number it is the number of args (separated by spaces).
@item keep
If true the args and the macro are kept, otherwise they are discarded.
The defaut is to have @code{keep} undef for all the commands.
If @code{keep} is true for @code{@@verbatiminclude} the default
action for this macro is not done.
@end table

These commands are processed by the @code{misc_command_line} function
reference.  This is somehow redundant with @ref{Formatting of simple line commands}.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} {($command, $line, $result)} misc_command_line $command $line \@@args \@@stack \%state
@var{$command} is the @@-command name.  @var{$line} is what the main program
would leave on the line.  @var{\@@args} holds the @@-command arguments.
@var{\@@stack} is an opaque variable.
@var{\%state} holds informations about the current context. 
The result is the @@-command that should be considered in the
main program, the line that should be processed further and 
the result of the command formatting.
@end deftypefn


Commands which do not appear in the hashes 
@code{%simple_map}, @code{%simple_map_pre},
@code{%simple_map_texi}, @code{%line_command_map} or @code{%misc_command}, 
or that appear in
@code{%misc_command} but with @code{keep} true are processed by the 
following function reference:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} {($result_line, $result, $result_text, $message)} unknown $command $line $pass
@var{$command} is the @@-command, @var{$line} is the line following the 
@var{$command}. @var{$pass} is the pass of texi2html (@pxref{Three passes}). 
@var{$result} is a boolean.  If it is true then the other return
values are taken into account otherwise the default actions are
used. In case @var{$result} is true, @var{$result_line} is the new line 
to be processed further, @var{$result_text} is the resulting formatted text 
and @var{$message}, if defined is a message outputted to the output
with line number added by @command{texi2any}.
@end deftypefn

Commands with braces not specified above 
nor in @code{%style_map}, @code{%style_map_pre} and
@code{%style_map_texi} are processed 
by the following function reference

@deftypefn {Function Reference} {($result, $result_text, $message)} unknown_style $command $text \%state $no_close $no_open
@var{$command} is the @@-command, @var{$text} is the text appearing within 
the braces (allready formatted).  
@var{\%state} holds informations about the current context. 
If @var{$text} is split in paragraphs each paragraph is passed through
the function, and @var{$no_close} is true if it is not the last paragraph,
while @var{$no_open} is true if it is not the first paragraph.
@var{$result} is a boolean.  If it is true then the other return
values are taken into account otherwise the default actions are
used.  In case @var{$result} is true, @var{$result_text} is the resulting
formatted text
and @var{$message}, if defined is a message outputted to the output
with line number added by @command{texi2any}.

The @code{NO_CSS} configuration option turns CSS support off.
Instead of CSS lines output at the document beginning, they may be added
to each of the HTML attributes, if @code{INLINE_CSS} is set.
The configuration variable variable holds the CSS
specification lines in case CSS is not inline.
@vindex %css_map
It is possible to modify the CSS lines by modifying
the entries or adding to the @code{%css_map} hash.  Each key is a CSS
selector, the corresponding value is a style string.

It is also possible to change completely the way @code{CSS_LINES}
are generated by redefining the following function reference:

@deffn {Function Reference} css_lines \@@import_lines \@@rule_lines
This function should be used to set the variable 
@code{CSS_LINES}.
@var{\@@import_lines} are the @code{@@import} lines of the 
files specified with @option{--include-css}, 
and @var{\@@rule_lines} are the css commands lines of these files.

@cindex Syntax, of @@-commands
@cindex Command syntax

The character @samp{@@} is used to start special Texinfo commands.
(It has the same meaning that @samp{\} has in plain @TeX{}.)  Texinfo
has four types of @@-command:@refill

@table @asis
@item 1. Non-alphabetic commands.
These commands consist of an @@ followed by a punctuation mark or
other character that is not part of the alphabet.  Non-alphabetic
commands are almost always part of the text within a paragraph.  The
non-alphabetic commands include @code{@@@@}, @code{@@@{}, @code{@@@}},
@code{@@.}, @code{@@@kbd{SPACE}}, most of the accent commands, and
many more.

@item 2. Alphabetic commands that do not require arguments.
These commands start with @@ followed by a word followed by left- and
right-hand braces.  These commands insert special symbols in the
document; they do not require arguments.  For example,
@code{@@dots@{@}} @result{} @samp{@dots{}}, @code{@@equiv@{@}}
@result{} @samp{@equiv{}}, @code{@@TeX@{@}} @result{} `@TeX{}',
and @code{@@bullet@{@}} @result{} @samp{@bullet{}}.

@item 3. Alphabetic commands that require arguments within braces.
These commands start with @@ followed by a letter or a word, followed by an
argument within braces.  For example, the command @code{@@dfn} indicates
the introductory or defining use of a term; it is used as follows: @samp{In
Texinfo, @@@@-commands are @@dfn@{mark-up@} commands.}@refill

@item 4. Alphabetic commands that occupy an entire line.
These commands occupy an entire line.  The line starts with @@,
followed by the name of the command (a word); for example, @code{@@center}
or @code{@@cindex}.  If no argument is needed, the word is followed by
the end of the line.  If there is an argument, it is separated from
the command name by a space.  Braces are not used.
@end table

@cindex Braces and argument syntax
Thus, the alphabetic commands fall into classes that have
different argument syntaxes.  You cannot tell to which class a command
belongs by the appearance of its name, but you can tell by the
command's meaning: if the command stands for a glyph, it is in
class 2 and does not require an argument; if it makes sense to use the
command together with other text as part of a paragraph, the command
is in class 3 and must be followed by an argument in braces;
otherwise, it is in class 4 and uses the rest of the line as its
argument.

The purpose of having a different syntax for commands of classes 3 and
4 is to make Texinfo files easier to read, and also to help the GNU
Emacs paragraph and filling commands work properly.  There is only one
exception to this rule: the command @code{@@refill}, which is always
used at the end of a paragraph immediately following the final period
or other punctuation character.  @code{@@refill} takes no argument and
does @emph{not} require braces.  @code{@@refill} never confuses the
Emacs paragraph commands because it cannot appear at the beginning of
a line.  It is also no longer needed, since all formatters now refill
paragraphs automatically.


@node Tips
@appendix Tips and Hints

Here are some tips for writing Texinfo documentation:@refill

@cindex Tips
@cindex Usage tips
@cindex Hints
@itemize @bullet
@item
Write in the present tense, not in the past or the future.

@item
Write actively!  For example, write ``We recommend that @dots{}'' rather
than ``It is recommended that @dots{}''.

@item
Use 70 or 72 as your fill column.  Longer lines are hard to read.

@item
Include a copyright notice and copying permissions.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Index, Index, Index!

Write many index entries, in different ways.
Readers like indices; they are helpful and convenient.

Although it is easiest to write index entries as you write the body of
the text, some people prefer to write entries afterwards.  In either
case, write an entry before the paragraph to which it applies.  This
way, an index entry points to the first page of a paragraph that is
split across pages.

Here are more hints we have found valuable:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Write each index entry differently, so each entry refers to a different
place in the document.

@item
Write index entries only where a topic is discussed significantly.  For
example, it is not useful to index ``debugging information'' in a
chapter on reporting bugs.  Someone who wants to know about debugging
information will certainly not find it in that chapter.

@item
Consistently capitalize the first word of every concept index entry,
or else consistently use lower case.  Terse entries often call for
lower case; longer entries for capitalization.  Whichever case
convention you use, please use one or the other consistently!  Mixing
the two styles looks bad.

@item
Always capitalize or use upper case for those words in an index for
which this is proper, such as names of countries or acronyms.  Always
use the appropriate case for case-sensitive names, such as those in C or
Lisp.

@item
Write the indexing commands that refer to a whole section immediately
after the section command, and write the indexing commands that refer to
a paragraph before that paragraph.

In the example that follows, a blank line comes after the index
entry for ``Leaping'':

@example
@group
@@section The Dog and the Fox
@@cindex Jumping, in general
@@cindex Leaping

@@cindex Dog, lazy, jumped over
@@cindex Lazy dog jumped over
@@cindex Fox, jumps over dog
@@cindex Quick fox jumps over dog
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
@end group
@end example

@noindent
(Note that the example shows entries for the same concept that are
written in different ways---@samp{Lazy dog}, and @samp{Dog, lazy}---so
readers can look up the concept in different ways.)
@end itemize

@subsubheading Blank Lines

@itemize @bullet
@item
Insert a blank line between a sectioning command and the first following
sentence or paragraph, or between the indexing commands associated with
the sectioning command and the first following sentence or paragraph, as
shown in the tip on indexing.  Otherwise, a formatter may fold title and
paragraph together.

@item
Always insert a blank line before an @code{@@table} command and after an
@code{@@end table} command; but never insert a blank line after an
@code{@@table} command or before an @code{@@end table} command.

@need 1000
For example,

@example
@group
Types of fox:

@@table @@samp
@@item Quick
Jump over lazy dogs.
@end group

@group
@@item Brown
Also jump over lazy dogs.
@@end table

@end group
@group
@@noindent
On the other hand, @dots{}
@end group
@end example

Insert blank lines before and after @code{@@itemize} @dots{} @code{@@end
itemize} and @code{@@enumerate} @dots{} @code{@@end enumerate} in the
same way.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Complete Phrases

Complete phrases are easier to read than @dots{}

@itemize @bullet
@item
Write entries in an itemized list as complete sentences; or at least, as
complete phrases.  Incomplete expressions @dots{} awkward @dots{} like
this.

@item
Write the prefatory sentence or phrase for a multi-item list or table as
a complete expression.  Do not write ``You can set:''; instead, write
``You can set these variables:''.  The former expression sounds cut off.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Editions, Dates and Versions

Include edition numbers, version numbers, and dates in the
@code{@@copying} text (for people reading the Texinfo file, and for the
legal copyright in the output files).  Then use @code{@@insertcopying}
in the @code{@@titlepage} section (for people reading the printed
output) and the Top node (for people reading the online output).

It is easiest to do this using @code{@@set} and @code{@@value}.
@xref{value Example, , @code{@@value} Example}, and @ref{GNU Sample Texts}.


@subsubheading Definition Commands

Definition commands are @code{@@deffn}, @code{@@defun},
@code{@@defmac}, and the like, and enable you to write descriptions in
a uniform format.@refill

@itemize @bullet
@item
Write just one definition command for each entity you define with a
definition command.  The automatic indexing feature creates an index
entry that leads the reader to the definition.

@item
Use @code{@@table} @dots{} @code{@@end table} in an appendix that
contains a summary of functions, not @code{@@deffn} or other definition
commands.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Capitalization

@itemize @bullet
@item
Capitalize ``Texinfo''; it is a name.  Do not write the @samp{x} or
@samp{i} in upper case.

@item
Capitalize ``Info''; it is a name.

@item
Write @TeX{} using the @code{@@TeX@{@}} command.  Note the uppercase
@samp{T} and @samp{X}.  This command causes the formatters to
typeset the name according to the wishes of Donald Knuth, who wrote
@TeX{}.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Spaces

Do not use spaces to format a Texinfo file, except inside of
@code{@@example} @dots{} @code{@@end example} and other literal
environments and commands.

@need 700
For example, @TeX{} fills the following:

@example
@group
   @@kbd@{C-x v@}
   @@kbd@{M-x vc-next-action@}
      Perform the next logical operation
      on the version-controlled file
      corresponding to the current buffer.
@end group
@end example

@need 950
@noindent
so it looks like this:

@iftex
@quotation
   @kbd{C-x v}
   @kbd{M-x vc-next-action}
      Perform the next logical operation on the version-controlled file
      corresponding to the current buffer.
@end quotation
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@quotation
`C-x v' `M-x vc-next-action' Perform the next logical operation on the
version-controlled file corresponding to the current buffer.
@end quotation
@end ifnottex

@noindent
In this case, the text should be formatted with
@code{@@table}, @code{@@item}, and @code{@@itemx}, to create a table.


@subsubheading @@code, @@samp, @@var, and @samp{---}

@itemize @bullet
@item
Use @code{@@code} around Lisp symbols, including command names.
For example,

@example
The main function is @@code@{vc-next-action@}, @dots{}
@end example

@item
Avoid putting letters such as @samp{s} immediately after an
@samp{@@code}.  Such letters look bad.

@item
Use @code{@@var} around meta-variables.  Do not write angle brackets
around them.

@item
Use three hyphens in a row, @samp{---}, to indicate a long dash.  @TeX{}
typesets these as a long dash and the Info formatters reduce three
hyphens to two.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Periods Outside of Quotes

Place periods and other punctuation marks @emph{outside} of quotations,
unless the punctuation is part of the quotation.  This practice goes
against publishing conventions in the United States, but enables the
reader to distinguish between the contents of the quotation and the
whole passage.

For example, you should write the following sentence with the period
outside the end quotation marks:

@example
Evidently, @samp{au} is an abbreviation for ``author''.
@end example

@noindent
since @samp{au} does @emph{not} serve as an  abbreviation for
@samp{author.} (with a period following the word).

@subsubheading Introducing New Terms

@itemize @bullet
@item
Introduce new terms so that a reader who does not know them can
understand them from context; or write a definition for the term.

For example, in the following, the terms ``check in'', ``register'' and
``delta'' are all appearing for the first time; the example sentence should be
rewritten so they are understandable.

@quotation
The major function assists you in checking in a file to your
version control system and registering successive sets of changes to
it as deltas.
@end quotation

@item
Use the @code{@@dfn} command around a word being introduced, to indicate
that the reader should not expect to know the meaning already, and
should expect to learn the meaning from this passage.
@end itemize

@subsubheading @@pxref

@c !!! maybe include this in the tips on pxref
@ignore
By the way, it is okay to use pxref with something else in front of
it within the parens, as long as the pxref is followed by the close
paren, and the material inside the parens is not part of a larger
sentence.  Also, you can use xref inside parens as part of a complete
sentence so long as you terminate the cross reference with punctuation.
@end ignore
Absolutely never use @code{@@pxref} except in the special context for
which it is designed: inside parentheses, with the closing parenthesis
following immediately after the closing brace.  One formatter
automatically inserts closing punctuation and the other does not.  This
means that the output looks right both in printed output and in an Info
file, but only when the command is used inside parentheses.

@subsubheading Invoking from a Shell

You can invoke programs such as Emacs, GCC, and @code{gawk} from a
shell.  The documentation for each program should contain a section that
describes this.  Unfortunately, if the node names and titles for these
sections are all different, they are difficult for users to find.

So, there is a convention to name such sections with a phrase beginning
with the word `Invoking', as in `Invoking Emacs'; this way, users can
find the section easily.


@subsubheading ANSI C Syntax

When you use @code{@@example} to describe a C function's calling
conventions, use the ANSI C syntax, like this:@refill

@example
void dld_init (char *@@var@{path@});
@end example

@noindent
And in the subsequent discussion, refer to the argument values by
writing the same argument names, again highlighted with
@code{@@var}.@refill

@need 800
Avoid the obsolete style that looks like this:@refill

@example
#include <dld.h>

dld_init (path)
char *path;
@end example

Also, it is best to avoid writing @code{#include} above the
declaration just to indicate that the function is declared in a
header file.  The practice may give the misimpression that the
@code{#include} belongs near the declaration of the function.  Either
state explicitly which header file holds the declaration or, better
yet, name the header file used for a group of functions at the
beginning of the section that describes the functions.@refill

@subsubheading Bad Examples

Here are several examples of bad writing to avoid:

In this example, say, `` @dots{} you must @code{@@dfn}@{check
in@} the new version.''  That flows better.

@quotation
When you are done editing the file, you must perform a
@code{@@dfn}@{check in@}.
@end quotation

In the following example, say, ``@dots{} makes a unified interface such as VC
mode possible.''

@quotation
SCCS, RCS and other version-control systems all perform similar
functions in broadly similar ways (it is this resemblance which makes
a unified control mode like this possible).
@end quotation

And in this example, you should specify what `it' refers to:

@quotation
If you are working with other people, it assists in coordinating
everyone's changes so they do not step on each other.
@end quotation

@subsubheading And Finally @dots{}

@itemize @bullet
@item
Pronounce @TeX{} as if the @samp{X} were a Greek `chi', as the last
sound in the name `Bach'.  But pronounce Texinfo as in `speck':
``teckinfo''.

@item
Write notes for yourself at the very end of a Texinfo file after the
@code{@@bye}.  None of the formatters process text after the
@code{@@bye}; it is as if the text were within @code{@@ignore} @dots{}
@code{@@end ignore}.
@end itemize

@cindex Sample texts, GNU
@cindex Full texts, GNU

Following is a sample Texinfo document with the full texts that should
be used (adapted as necessary) in GNU manuals.

As well as the legal texts, it also serves as a practical example of how
many elements in a GNU system can affect the manual.  If you're not
familiar with all these different elements, don't worry.  They're not
required and a perfectly good manual can be written without them.
They're included here nonetheless because many manuals do (or could)
benefit from them.

@xref{Short Sample}, for a minimal example of a Texinfo file.
@xref{Beginning a File}, for a full explanation of that minimal
example.

Here are some notes on the example:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@cindex $Id
@cindex CVS $Id
@cindex RCS $Id
@cindex Documentation identification
@cindex Identification of documentation
The @samp{$Id:} comment is for the CVS (@pxref{Top,, Overview, cvs,
Concurrent Versions System}) or RCS
(@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs}) version control systems, which
expand it into a string such as:
@example
$Id: texinfo.txi,v 1.276 2010/07/31 14:25:20 karl Exp $
@end example
(This is useful in all sources that use version control, not just manuals.)
You may wish to include the @samp{$Id:} comment in the @code{@@copying}
text, if you want a completely unambiguous reference to the
documentation version.

If you want to literally write @t{@w{$}Id$}, use @code{@@w}:
@code{@@w@{$@}Id$}.  Unfortunately, this technique does not work in
plain text output, where it's not clear what should be done.

@item
@pindex automake@r{, and version info}
@vindex UPDATED @r{Automake variable}

@pindex time-stamp.el
The @file{version.texi} in the @code{@@include} command is maintained
automatically by Automake (@pxref{Top,, Introduction, automake, GNU

Emacs, you may find the time-stamp.el package helpful (@pxref{Time

It is best to include the entire GNU Free Documentation License in a GNU
manual, unless the manual is only a few pages long.  Of course this
sample is even shorter than that, but it includes the FDL anyway in
order to show one conventional way to do so.  The @file{fdl.texi} file
is available on the GNU machines and in the Texinfo and other GNU
source distributions.

The FDL provides for omitting itself under certain conditions, but in
that case the sample texts given here have to be modified.  @xref{GNU

@item
If the FSF is not the copyright holder, then use the appropriate name.

@item
If your manual is not published on paper by the FSF, then definitely
omit the last sentence in the Back-Cover Text that talks about copies
from GNU Press.

@item
GNU packages can entirely omit both cover texts if it is not published
on paper by the FSF, at the package maintainer's discretion.

@item
If your manual has Invariant Sections (again, see the license itself
for details), then change the text here accordingly.

@item
For documents that express your personal views, feelings or experiences,
it is more appropriate to use a license permitting only verbatim

@node Headings Introduced
@section Headings Introduced

Texinfo provides standard page heading formats for manuals that are
printed on one side of each sheet of paper and for manuals that are
printed on both sides of the paper.  Typically, you will use these
formats, but you can specify your own format if you wish.@refill

In addition, you can specify whether chapters should begin on a new
page, or merely continue the same page as the previous chapter; and if
chapters begin on new pages, you can specify whether they must be
odd-numbered pages.@refill

By convention, a book is printed on both sides of each sheet of paper.
When you open a book, the right-hand page is odd-numbered, and
chapters begin on right-hand pages---a preceding left-hand page is
left blank if necessary.  Reports, however, are often printed on just
one side of paper, and chapters begin on a fresh page immediately
following the end of the preceding chapter.  In short or informal
reports, chapters often do not begin on a new page at all, but are
separated from the preceding text by a small amount of whitespace.@refill

The @code{@@setchapternewpage} command controls whether chapters begin
on new pages, and whether one of the standard heading formats is used.
In addition, Texinfo has several heading and footing commands that you
can use to generate your own heading and footing formats.@refill

In Texinfo, headings and footings are single lines at the tops and
bottoms of pages; you cannot create multiline headings or footings.
Each header or footer line is divided into three parts: a left part, a
middle part, and a right part.  Any part, or a whole line, may be left
blank.  Text for the left part of a header or footer line is set
flushleft; text for the middle part is centered; and, text for the
right part is set flushright.@refill

@node Heading Format
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Standard Heading Formats

Texinfo provides two standard heading formats, one for manuals printed
on one side of each sheet of paper, and the other for manuals printed
on both sides of the paper.

By default, nothing is specified for the footing of a Texinfo file,
so the footing remains blank.@refill

The standard format for single-sided printing consists of a header
line in which the left-hand part contains the name of the chapter, the
central part is blank, and the right-hand part contains the page
number.@refill

@need 950
A single-sided page looks like this:

@example
@group
  _______________________
 |                       |
 | chapter   page number |
 |                       |
 | Start of text ...     |
 | ...                   |
 |                       |
@end group
@end example

The standard format for two-sided printing depends on whether the page
number is even or odd.  By convention, even-numbered pages are on the
left- and odd-numbered pages are on the right.  (@TeX{} will adjust the
widths of the left- and right-hand margins.  Usually, widths are
correct, but during double-sided printing, it is wise to check that
pages will bind properly---sometimes a printer will produce output in
which the even-numbered pages have a larger right-hand margin than the
odd-numbered pages.)@refill

In the standard double-sided format, the left part of the left-hand
(even-numbered) page contains the page number, the central part is
blank, and the right part contains the title (specified by the
@code{@@settitle} command).  The left part of the right-hand
(odd-numbered) page contains the name of the chapter, the central part

@section Specifying the Type of Heading

@TeX{} does not begin to generate page headings for a standard Texinfo
file until it reaches the @code{@@end titlepage} command.  Thus, the
title and copyright pages are not numbered.  The @code{@@end
titlepage} command causes @TeX{} to begin to generate page headings
according to a standard format specified by the
@code{@@setchapternewpage} command that precedes the
@code{@@titlepage} section.@refill

@need 1000
There are four possibilities:@refill

@table @asis
@item No @code{@@setchapternewpage} command
Cause @TeX{} to specify the single-sided heading format, with chapters
on new pages. This is the same as @code{@@setchapternewpage on}.@refill

@item @code{@@setchapternewpage on}
Specify the single-sided heading format, with chapters on new pages.@refill

@item @code{@@setchapternewpage off}
Cause @TeX{} to start a new chapter on the same page as the last page of
the preceding chapter, after skipping some vertical whitespace.  Also
cause @TeX{} to typeset for single-sided printing.  (You can override
the headers format with the @code{@@headings double} command; see
@ref{headings on off, , The @code{@@headings} Command}.)@refill

@item @code{@@setchapternewpage odd}
Specify the double-sided heading format, with chapters on new pages.@refill
@end table

@noindent
Texinfo lacks an @code{@@setchapternewpage even} command.@refill

@node Custom Headings
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section How to Make Your Own Headings

You can use the standard headings provided with Texinfo or specify
your own.  By default, Texinfo has no footers, so if you specify them,
the available page size for the main text will be slightly reduced.

Texinfo provides six commands for specifying headings and
footings:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{@@everyheading} @code{@@everyfooting} generate page headers and
footers that are the same for both even- and odd-numbered pages.
@item
@code{@@evenheading} and @code{@@evenfooting} command generate headers
and footers for even-numbered (left-hand) pages.
@item
@code{@@oddheading} and @code{@@oddfooting} generate headers and footers
for odd-numbered (right-hand) pages.
@end itemize

Write custom heading specifications in the Texinfo file immediately
after the @code{@@end titlepage} command.
You must cancel the predefined heading commands with the
@code{@@headings off} command before defining your own
specifications.

@need 1000
Here is how to tell @TeX{} to place the chapter name at the left, the
page number in the center, and the date at the right of every header
for both even- and odd-numbered pages:

@example
@group
@@headings off
@@everyheading @@thischapter @@| @@thispage @@| @@today@{@}
@end group
@end example

@noindent
You need to divide the left part from the central part and the central
part from the right part by inserting @samp{@@|} between parts.
Otherwise, the specification command will not be able to tell where
the text for one part ends and the next part begins.

Each part can contain text or @@-commands.  The text
is printed as if the part were within an ordinary paragraph in the
body of the page.  The @@-commands replace
themselves with the page number, date, chapter name, or
whatever.

@need 950
Here are the six heading and footing commands:

@table @code
@item @@everyheading @var{left} @@| @var{center} @@| @var{right}
@itemx @@everyfooting @var{left} @@| @var{center} @@| @var{right}
@findex everyheading
@findex everyfooting
The `every' commands specify the format for both even- and odd-numbered
pages.  These commands are for documents that are printed on one side
of each sheet of paper, or for documents in which you want symmetrical
headers or footers.

@item @@evenheading @var{left} @@| @var{center} @@| @var{right}
@itemx @@oddheading  @var{left} @@| @var{center} @@| @var{right}
@itemx @@evenfooting @var{left} @@| @var{center} @@| @var{right}
@itemx @@oddfooting  @var{left} @@| @var{center} @@| @var{right}
@findex evenheading
@findex evenfooting
@findex oddheading
@findex oddfooting
The `even' and `odd' commands specify the format for even-numbered
pages and odd-numbered pages.  These commands are for books and
manuals that are printed on both sides of each sheet of paper.
@end table

Use the @samp{@@this@dots{}} series of @@-commands to
provide the names of chapters
and sections and the page number.  You can use the
@samp{@@this@dots{}} commands in the left, center, or right portions
of headers and footers, or anywhere else in a Texinfo file so long as
they are between @code{@@iftex} and @code{@@end iftex} commands.

@need 1000
Here are the @samp{@@this@dots{}} commands:

@table @code
@item @@thispage
@findex thispage
Expands to the current page number.

@item @@thissectionname
@findex thissectionname
Expands to the name of the current section.

@item @@thissectionnum
@findex thissectionnum
Expands to the number of the current section.

@item @@thissection
@findex thissection
Expands to the number and name of the current section, in the format
`Section 1: Title'.

@item @@thischaptername
@findex thischaptername
Expands to the name of the current chapter.

@item @@thischapternum
@findex thischapternum
Expands to the number of the current chapter, or letter of the current
appendix.

@item @@thischapter
@findex thischapter
Expands to the number and name of the current
chapter, in the format `Chapter 1: Title'.

@item @@thistitle
@findex thistitle
Expands to the name of the document, as specified by the
@code{@@settitle} command.

@item @@thisfile
@findex thisfile
For @code{@@include} files only: expands to the name of the current
@code{@@include} file.  If the current Texinfo source file is not an
@code{@@include} file, this command has no effect.  This command does
@emph{not} provide the name of the current Texinfo source file unless
it is an @code{@@include} file.  (@xref{Include Files}, for more
information about @code{@@include} files.)
@end table

@noindent
You can also use the @code{@@today@{@}} command, which expands to the
current date, in `1 Jan 1900' format.
@findex today

Other @@-commands and text are printed in a header or footer just as
if they were in the body of a page.  It is useful to incorporate text,
particularly when you are writing drafts:

@example
@group
@@headings off
@@everyheading @@emph@{Draft!@} @@| @@thispage @@| @@thischapter
@@everyfooting @@| @@| Version: 0.27: @@today@{@}
@end group
@end example

Beware of overlong titles: they may overlap another part of the
header or footer and blot it out.

If you have very short chapters and/or sections, several of them can
appear on a single page.  You can specify which chapters and sections
you want @code{@@thischapter}, @code{@@thissection} and other such
macros to refer to on such pages as follows:

@table @code
@item @@everyheadingmarks @var{ref}
@itemx @@everyfootingmarks @var{ref}
@findex everyheadingmarks
@findex everyfootingmarks
The @var{ref} argument can be either @code{top} (the @code{@@this...}
commands will refer to the chapter/section at the top of a page) or
@code{bottom} (the commands will reflect the situation at the bottom
of a page).  These @samp{@@every...} commands specify what to do on
both even- and odd-numbered pages.

@item @@evenheadingmarks @var{ref}
@itemx @@oddheadingmarks @var{ref}
@itemx @@evenfootingmarks @var{ref}
@itemx @@oddfootingmarks @var{ref}
@findex evenheadingmarks
@findex oddheadingmarks
@findex evenfootingmarks
@findex oddfootingmarks
These @samp{@@even...} and @samp{@@odd...} commands specify what to do
on only even- or odd-numbered pages, respectively.  The @var{ref}
argument is the same as with the @samp{@@every...} commands.
@end table

Write these commands immediately after the @code{@@...contents}
commands, or after the @code{@@end titlepage} command if you don't
have a table of contents or if it is printed at the end of your
manual.

By default the @code{@@this...} commands reflect the situation at the
bottom of a page both in headings and in footings.

Besides mistakes in the content of your documentation, there are two
kinds of mistake you can make with Texinfo: you can make mistakes with
@@-commands, and you can make mistakes with the structure of the nodes
and chapters.

Emacs has two tools for catching the @@-command mistakes and two for
catching structuring mistakes.@refill

For finding problems with @@-commands, you can run @TeX{} or a region
formatting command on the region that has a problem; indeed, you can
run these commands on each region as you write it.@refill

For finding problems with the structure of nodes and chapters, you can use
@kbd{C-c C-s} (@code{texinfo-show-structure}) and the related @code{occur}
command and you can use the @kbd{M-x Info-validate} command.@refill

@node makeinfo Preferred
@section @code{makeinfo} Find Errors

The @code{makeinfo} program does an excellent job of catching errors
and reporting them---far better than @code{texinfo-format-region} or
@code{texinfo-format-buffer}.  In addition, the various functions for
automatically creating and updating node pointers and menus remove
many opportunities for human error.@refill

If you can, use the updating commands to create and insert pointers
and menus.  These prevent many errors.  Then use @code{makeinfo} (or
its Texinfo mode manifestations, @code{makeinfo-region} and
@code{makeinfo-buffer}) to format your file and check for other
errors.  This is the best way to work with Texinfo.  But if you
cannot use @code{makeinfo}, or your problem is very puzzling, then you
may want to use the tools described in this appendix.@refill

@node Debugging with Info
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Catching Errors with Info Formatting
@cindex Catching errors with Info formatting
@cindex Debugging with Info formatting

After you have written part of a Texinfo file, you can use the
@code{texinfo-format-region} or the @code{makeinfo-region} command to
see whether the region formats properly.@refill

Most likely, however, you are reading this section because for some
reason you cannot use the @code{makeinfo-region} command; therefore, the
rest of this section presumes that you are using
@code{texinfo-format-region}.@refill

If you have made a mistake with an @@-command,
@code{texinfo-format-region} will stop processing at or after the
error and display an error message.  To see where in the buffer the
error occurred, switch to the @samp{*Info Region*} buffer; the cursor
will be in a position that is after the location of the error.  Also,
the text will not be formatted after the place where the error
occurred (or more precisely, where it was detected).@refill

For example, if you accidentally end a menu with the command @code{@@end
menus} with an `s' on the end, instead of with @code{@@end menu}, you
will see an error message that says:@refill

@example
@@end menus is not handled by texinfo
@end example

@noindent
The cursor will stop at the point in the buffer where the error
occurs, or not long after it.  The buffer will look like this:@refill

@example
@group
---------- Buffer: *Info Region* ----------
* Menu:

---------- Buffer: *Info Region* ----------
@end group
@end example

The @code{texinfo-format-region} command sometimes provides slightly
odd error messages.  For example, the following cross reference fails to format:@refill

@example
(@@xref@{Catching Mistakes, for more info.)
@end example

@noindent
In this case, @code{texinfo-format-region} detects the missing closing
brace but displays a message that says @samp{Unbalanced parentheses}
rather than @samp{Unbalanced braces}.  This is because the formatting
command looks for mismatches between braces as if they were
parentheses.@refill

Sometimes @code{texinfo-format-region} fails to detect mistakes.  For
example, in the following, the closing brace is swapped with the
closing parenthesis:@refill

@example
(@@xref@{Catching Mistakes), for more info.@}
@end example

@noindent
Formatting produces:
@example
(*Note for more info.: Catching Mistakes)
@end example

The only way for you to detect this error is to realize that the
reference should have looked like this:@refill

@example
(*Note Catching Mistakes::, for more info.)
@end example

Incidentally, if you are reading this node in Info and type @kbd{f
@key{RET}} (@code{Info-follow-reference}), you will generate an error
message that says:

@example
No such node: "Catching Mistakes) The only way @dots{}
@end example

@noindent
This is because Info perceives the example of the error as the first
cross reference in this node and if you type a @key{RET} immediately
after typing the Info @kbd{f} command, Info will attempt to go to the
referenced node.  If you type @kbd{f catch @key{TAB} @key{RET}}, Info
will complete the node name of the correctly written example and take
you to the `Catching Mistakes' node.  (If you try this, you can return
from the `Catching Mistakes' node by typing @kbd{l}
(@code{Info-last}).)

@c !!! section on using Elisp debugger ignored.
@ignore
Sometimes @code{texinfo-format-region} will stop long after the
original error; this is because it does not discover the problem until
then.  In this case, you will need to backtrack.@refill

If an error is especially elusive, you can turn on the Emacs Lisp
debugger and look at the backtrace; this tells you where in the
@code{texinfo-format-region} function the problem occurred.  You can
turn on the debugger with the command:@refill

@example
M-x set-variable @key{RET} debug-on-error @key{RET} t @key{RET}
@end example

@noindent
and turn it off with

@example
M-x set-variable @key{RET} debug-on-error @key{RET} nil @key{RET}
@end example

Often, when you are using the debugger, it is easier to follow what is
going on if you use the Emacs Lisp files that are not byte-compiled.
The byte-compiled sources send octal numbers to the debugger that may
look mysterious.  To use the uncompiled source files, load
@file{texinfmt.el} and @file{texinfo.el} with the @kbd{M-x load-file}
command.@refill

The debugger will not catch an error if @code{texinfo-format-region}
does not detect one.  In the example shown above,
@code{texinfo-format-region} did not find the error when the whole
list was formatted, but only when part of the list was formatted.
When @code{texinfo-format-region} did not find an error, the debugger
did not find one either. @refill

However, when @code{texinfo-format-region} did report an error, it
invoked the debugger.  This is the backtrace it produced:@refill

@example
---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
Signalling: (search-failed "[@},]")
 re-search-forward("[@},]")
 (while ...)
 (let ...)
 texinfo-format-parse-args()

---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
@end example

The backtrace is read from the bottom up.
@code{texinfo-format-region} was called interactively; and it, in
turn, called various functions, including @code{texinfo-format-scan},
@code{texinfo-format-xref} and @code{texinfo-format-parse-args}.
Inside the function @code{texinfo-format-parse-args}, the function
@code{re-search-forward} was called; it was this function that could
not find the missing right-hand brace.@refill

@section Catching Errors with @TeX{} Formatting
@cindex Catching errors with @TeX{} formatting

You can also catch mistakes when you format a file with @TeX{}.@refill

Usually, you will want to do this after you have run
@code{texinfo-format-buffer} (or, better, @code{makeinfo-buffer}) on
the same file, because @code{texinfo-format-buffer} sometimes displays
error messages that make more sense than @TeX{}.  (@xref{Debugging

For example, @TeX{} was run on a Texinfo file, part of which is shown
here:@refill

@example

@@samp@{??@} are `wildcards' that cause the shell to

@noindent
(The cross reference lacks a closing brace.)
@TeX{} produced the following output, after which it stopped:@refill

@example

                  @@par

?
---------- Buffer: *tex-shell* ----------
@end example

In this case, @TeX{} produced an accurate and
understandable error message:

@example
Paragraph ended before @@xref was complete.
@end example

@noindent
@samp{@@par} is an internal @TeX{} command of no relevance to Texinfo.
@samp{l.27} means that @TeX{} detected the problem on line 27 of the
Texinfo file.  The @samp{?} is the prompt @TeX{} uses in this
circumstance.@refill

Unfortunately, @TeX{} is not always so helpful, and sometimes you must
truly be a Sherlock Holmes to discover what went wrong.@refill

In any case, if you run into a problem like this, you can do one of three
things.@refill

@enumerate
@item
You can tell @TeX{} to continue running and ignore just this error by
typing @key{RET} at the @samp{?} prompt.@refill

@item
You can tell @TeX{} to continue running and to ignore all errors as best
it can by typing @kbd{r @key{RET}} at the @samp{?} prompt.@refill

This is often the best thing to do.  However, beware: the one error
may produce a cascade of additional error messages as its consequences
are felt through the rest of the file.  To stop @TeX{} when it is
producing such an avalanche of error messages, type @kbd{C-c} (or
@kbd{C-c C-c}, if you are running a shell inside Emacs).

@item
You can tell @TeX{} to stop this run by typing @kbd{x @key{RET}}
at the @samp{?} prompt.@refill
@end enumerate

If you are running @TeX{} inside Emacs, you need to switch to the shell
buffer and line at which @TeX{} offers the @samp{?} prompt.

Sometimes @TeX{} will format a file without producing error messages even
though there is a problem.  This usually occurs if a command is not ended
but @TeX{} is able to continue processing anyhow.  For example, if you fail
to end an itemized list with the @code{@@end itemize} command, @TeX{} will
write a DVI file that you can print out.  The only error message that
@TeX{} will give you is the somewhat mysterious comment that@refill

@example
(@@end occurred inside a group at level 1)
@end example

@noindent
However, if you print the DVI file, you will find that the text
of the file that follows the itemized list is entirely indented as if
it were part of the last item in the itemized list.  The error message
is the way @TeX{} says that it expected to find an @code{@@end}
command somewhere in the file; but that it could not determine where
it was needed.@refill

Another source of notoriously hard-to-find errors is a missing
@code{@@end group} command.  If you ever are stumped by
incomprehensible errors, look for a missing @code{@@end group} command
first.@refill

If the Texinfo file lacks header lines,
@TeX{} may stop in the
beginning of its run and display output that looks like the following.
The @samp{*} indicates that @TeX{} is waiting for input.@refill

@example
This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2c 7.0)
(test.texinfo [1])
*
@end example

@noindent
In this case, simply type @kbd{\end @key{RET}} after the asterisk.  Then
write the header lines in the Texinfo file and run the @TeX{} command
again. (Note the use of the backslash, @samp{\}.  @TeX{} uses @samp{\}
instead of @samp{@@}; and in this circumstance, you are working
directly with @TeX{}, not with Texinfo.)@refill

It is not always easy to keep track of the nodes, chapters, sections, and
subsections of a Texinfo file.  This is especially true if you are revising
or adding to a Texinfo file that someone else has written.@refill

In GNU Emacs, in Texinfo mode, the @code{texinfo-show-structure}
command lists all the lines that begin with the @@-commands that
specify the structure: @code{@@chapter}, @code{@@section},
@code{@@appendix}, and so on.  With an argument (@w{@kbd{C-u}}
as prefix argument, if interactive),
the command also shows the @code{@@node} lines.  The
@code{texinfo-show-structure} command is bound to @kbd{C-c C-s} in
Texinfo mode, by default.@refill

The lines are displayed in a buffer called the @samp{*Occur*} buffer,
indented by hierarchical level.  For example, here is a part of what was
produced by running @code{texinfo-show-structure} on this manual:@refill

the corresponding spot in the Texinfo file.  @xref{Other Repeating
Search, , Using Occur, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}, for more
information about @code{occur-mode-goto-occurrence}.@refill

The first line in the @samp{*Occur*} window describes the @dfn{regular

expression is the pattern that @code{texinfo-show-structure} looks for.
@xref{Regexps, , Using Regular Expressions, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual},

When you invoke the @code{texinfo-show-structure} command, Emacs will
display the structure of the whole buffer.  If you want to see the
structure of just a part of the buffer, of one chapter, for example,
use the @kbd{C-x n n} (@code{narrow-to-region}) command to mark the
region.  (@xref{Narrowing, , , emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}.)  This is
how the example used above was generated.  (To see the whole buffer

If you call @code{texinfo-show-structure} with a prefix argument by

@code{@@node} as well as the lines beginning with the @@-sign commands
for @code{@@chapter}, @code{@@section}, and the like.@refill

You can remind yourself of the structure of a Texinfo file by looking at

Sometimes the @code{texinfo-show-structure} command produces too much

of a Texinfo file, and are overwhelmed by the detailed list produced by
@code{texinfo-show-structure}.  In this case, you can use the @code{occur}
command directly.  To do this, type@refill

@noindent
and then, when prompted, type a @dfn{regexp}, a regular expression for
the pattern you want to match.  (@xref{Regexps, , Regular Expressions,
emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}.)  The @code{occur} command works from
the current location of the cursor in the buffer to the end of the
buffer.  If you want to run @code{occur} on the whole buffer, place
the cursor at the beginning of the buffer.@refill

For example, to see all the lines that contain the word
@samp{@@chapter} in them, just type @samp{@@chapter}.  This will
produce a list of the chapters.  It will also list all the sentences
with @samp{@@chapter} in the middle of the line.@refill

If you want to see only those lines that start with the word
@samp{@@chapter}, type @samp{^@@chapter} when prompted by
@code{occur}.  If you want to see all the lines that end with a word
or phrase, end the last word with a @samp{$}; for example,
@samp{catching mistakes$}.  This can be helpful when you want to see
all the nodes that are part of the same chapter or section and
therefore have the same `Up' pointer.@refill

You can use the @code{Info-validate} command to check whether any of
the `Next', `Previous', `Up' or other node pointers fail to point to a
node.  This command checks that every node pointer points to an
existing node.  The @code{Info-validate} command works only on Info
files, not on Texinfo files.@refill

The @code{makeinfo} program validates pointers automatically, so you
do not need to use the @code{Info-validate} command if you are using
@code{makeinfo}.  You only may need to use @code{Info-validate} if you
are unable to run @code{makeinfo} and instead must create an Info file
using @code{texinfo-format-region} or @code{texinfo-format-buffer}, or
if you write an Info file from scratch.@refill

@subsection Running @code{Info-validate}

@cindex Validating a large file

To use @code{Info-validate}, visit the Info file you wish to check and
type:@refill

@example
M-x Info-validate
@end example

@noindent
Note that the @code{Info-validate} command requires an upper case
`I'.  You may also need to create a tag table before running
@code{Info-validate}.  @xref{Tagifying}.

If your file is valid, you will receive a message that says ``File appears
valid''.  However, if you have a pointer that does not point to a node,
error messages will be displayed in a buffer called @samp{*problems in
info file*}.@refill

For example, @code{Info-validate} was run on a test file that contained
only the first node of this manual.  One of the messages said:@refill

@example
In node "Overview", invalid Next: Texinfo Mode
@end example

@noindent
This meant that the node called @samp{Overview} had a `Next' pointer that
did not point to anything (which was true in this case, since the test file
had only one node in it).@refill

Now suppose we add a node named @samp{Texinfo Mode} to our test case
but we do not specify a `Previous' for this node.  Then we will get
the following error message:@refill

@example
In node "Texinfo Mode", should have Previous: Overview
@end example

@noindent
This is because every `Next' pointer should be matched by a
`Previous' (in the node where the `Next' points) which points back.@refill

@code{Info-validate} also checks that all menu entries and cross references
point to actual nodes.@refill

@code{Info-validate} requires a tag table and does not work with files
that have been split.  (The @code{texinfo-format-buffer} command
automatically splits large files.)  In order to use @code{Info-validate}
on a large file, you must run @code{texinfo-format-buffer} with an
argument so that it does not split the Info file; and you must create a
tag table for the unsplit file.

@node Unsplit
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@subsection Creating an Unsplit File
@cindex Creating an unsplit file
@cindex Unsplit file creation

You can run @code{Info-validate} only on a single Info file that has a
tag table.  The command will not work on the indirect subfiles that
are generated when a master file is split.  If you have a large file
(longer than 300,000 bytes or so), you need to run the
@code{texinfo-format-buffer} or @code{makeinfo-buffer} command in such
a way that it does not create indirect subfiles.  You will also need
to create a tag table for the Info file.  After you have done this,
you can run @code{Info-validate} and look for badly referenced
nodes.@refill

The first step is to create an unsplit Info file.  To prevent
@code{texinfo-format-buffer} from splitting a Texinfo file into
smaller Info files, give a prefix to the @kbd{M-x
texinfo-format-buffer} command:@refill

@example
C-u M-x texinfo-format-buffer
@end example

@noindent
or else

@example
C-u C-c C-e C-b
@end example

@noindent
When you do this, Texinfo will not split the file and will not create
a tag table for it. @refill
@cindex Making a tag table manually
@cindex Tag table, making manually

@node Tagifying
@subsection Tagifying a File

After creating an unsplit Info file, you must create a tag table for
it.  Visit the Info file you wish to tagify and type:@refill

@example
M-x Info-tagify
@end example

@noindent
(Note the upper case @samp{I} in @code{Info-tagify}.)  This creates an
Info file with a tag table that you can validate.@refill

The third step is to validate the Info file:@refill

@example
M-x Info-validate
@end example

@noindent
(Note the upper case @samp{I} in @code{Info-validate}.)
In brief, the steps are:@refill

@example
@group
C-u M-x texinfo-format-buffer
M-x Info-tagify
M-x Info-validate
@end group
@end example

After you have validated the node structure, you can rerun
@code{texinfo-format-buffer} in the normal way so it will construct a
tag table and split the file automatically, or you can make the tag
table and split the file manually.@refill

@node Splitting
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@subsection Splitting a File Manually
@cindex Splitting an Info file manually
@cindex Info file, splitting manually

You should split a large file or else let the
@code{texinfo-format-buffer} or @code{makeinfo-buffer} command do it
for you automatically.  (Generally you will let one of the formatting
commands do this job for you.  @xref{Creating an Info File}.)@refill

The split-off files are called the indirect subfiles.@refill

Info files are split to save memory.  With smaller files, Emacs does not
have make such a large buffer to hold the information.@refill

If an Info file has more than 30 nodes, you should also make a tag
table for it. @xref{Using Info-validate}, for information
about creating a tag table.  (Again, tag tables are usually created
automatically by the formatting command; you only need to create a tag
table yourself if you are doing the job manually.  Most likely, you
will do this for a large, unsplit file on which you have run
@code{Info-validate}.)@refill

@c Info-split is autoloaded in `loaddefs.el' in Emacs 18.51
@ignore
Before running @code{Info-split}, you need to load the @code{info} library
into Emacs by giving the command @kbd{M-x load-library @key{RET} info
@key{RET}}.
@end ignore

Visit the Info file you wish to tagify and split and type the two
commands:@refill

@example
M-x Info-tagify
M-x Info-split
@end example

@noindent
(Note that the @samp{I} in @samp{Info} is upper case.)@refill

When you use the @code{Info-split} command, the buffer is modified into a
(small) Info file which lists the indirect subfiles.  This file should be
saved in place of the original visited file.  The indirect subfiles are
written in the same directory the original file is in, with names generated
by appending @samp{-} and a number to the original file name.@refill

The primary file still functions as an Info file, but it contains just
the tag table and a directory of subfiles.@refill

@appendix Texi2HTML history and relations with @command{makeinfo}

In 2010 Texi2HTML was merged in GNU Texinfo.  Some informations
are retained here, mainly for historical purposes.

@end menu

@node Texi2HTML history
@appendixsec Texi2HTML history and merge in Texinfo

In early 1998 @command{makeinfo} wasn't able to produce
HTML output format, but people still wanted documentation in
HTML.  This was the birthing hour for @command{texi2html},
with original author Lionel Cons.  The basic purpose of 
@command{texi2html} was to convert Texinfo documents into HTML.

Since then, HTML support in @command{makeinfo} improved, but
@command{texi2html} was still stronger in some areas, including the degree to
which it allows customization.  After being briefly maintained by Karl
Berry in 1999, Olaf Bachmann was the maintainer until 2000, adding many 
features.  Adrian Aichner and Derek Price took over maintainance in 2001 
and Derek was the maintainer from 2003 to 2010, with some help from 
Patrice Dumas.

In 2010, @command{texi2html}, then hosted
at @uref{http://www.nongnu.org/texi2html/} was made
compatible with @command{makeinfo}, losing the focus on HTML to become a
more generic translator, and merged in 
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/, GNU Texinfo} to
replace @command{makeinfo} in C.
@command{texi2html} is now installed as part of the texinfo package install,
as an alias of @command{texi2any}.  The @command{texi2html} documentation 
is also merged here in the Texinfo manual, as 
the @command{texi2any}/@command{makeinfo} documentation.

@item @@verbatiminclude is now a $raw command argument distinct from @@verbatim.
@item @@direntry is formatted like a menu and passed down to $menu_command.
@item add $NODE_FILENAMES to use node names for files associated with nodes,

@item print_element_header is obsoleted, 
things should be directly done in element_heading.
@item Add 'inline_attribute' for an XML attribute that should be closed at
  paragraph end and reopened at paragraph begin. Consequently the closing
  and opening of 'attribute' isn't done anymore in paragraph and 
  preformatted.
@item USE_ISO now only determines if @code{''}, @code{``} @code{---} and @code{--} are transformed
  into entities. t2h_default_set_iso_symbols sets or unsets USE_ISO,
  %things_map/%pre_map/%simple_format_simple_map_texi,

@item $internal_ref and $external_ref don't change inforef to xref anymore.
@item in $table_item the text is not formatted with the format command,
  the text_formatted argument is.
@item definition index entries are now formatted with $definition_index_entry,
  not with $definition_category anymore.
@item $printindex is called if an index appears, even if the index is not 
defined or there are no index entries.
@item  new argument (@@-command name) for $quotation and $quotation_prepend_text.
@item change in the heading API. THIS_HEADER is not used anymore.
  New function reference, element_heading  to format a node or a section 
  heading, including navigation and label. Accordingly, print_Top and 
  one_section don't print the element header anymore. Also it is
  reported if the element is a new element, is the main element and
  more arguments, and top element heading is always done in heading.
@item  print_element_header and print_navigation now return their result.	
@item the @code{copying} key of %Texi2HTML::THISDOC is now called
@code{copying_comment}.
@item TOC_LIST_ATTRIBUTE is now called NO_BULLET_LIST_ATTRIBUTE.
@item TOC_LIST_STYLE is now called NO_BULLET_LIST_STYLE.

@item @code{&$menu_comment} is removed, @code{menu_comment} is now handled
  like an @@-command.
@item @code{@@detailmenu} is now formatted more like @code{@@menu}, and
the @code{&$menu} function reference is replaced by @code{&$menu_command}.
@code{&$menu} is kept for backward compatibility. If @code{&$menu} is defined, 
@code{@@detailmenu} is ignored.
@item the API for the formatting of menus completly changed. $simple_menu_link
  is removed, everything should be done in $menu_link.
@item image API changed, and is unstable, so not documented.
@item image file paths are not completed anymore in the default case. 
  The previous
  behaviour can be restored with @code{$COMPLETE_IMAGE_PATHS} set to true.
@item in %misc_command @samp{texi} is not used anymore. The value and macros
are expanded as they should be unconditionnally.
@item there is a new 'style' key in $complex_format_map, to be able to 
  differentiate complex formats inheriting fonts and code_style (like 
  @@format, @@display).
@item $EXTENSION should be undef if one doesn't want an extension to be added.
@item THISDOC@{'title'@} and similar are now for @@title since only one @@title
  should appear in the document. @@settitle is tried first to set fulltitle.
@item Configuration variables are modified anymore, instead the variable
  value is put in $Texi2HTML::THISDOC@{'VAR'@}. This is the case for
  DO_CONTENTS, DO_SCONTENTS, CSS_LINES, BODYTEXT, DOCUMENT_DESCRIPTION,
  DOCUMENT_ENCODING, IN_ENCODING, ENCODING_NAME, OUT_ENCODING.

  For example, if $CSS_LINES is defined, the value is put in 
  $Texi2HTML::THISDOC@{'CSS_LINES'@} which is used for formatting, and if
  $CSS_LINES is not defined, $Texi2HTML::THISDOC@{'CSS_LINES'@} is 
  autodetected.
@item  When there is no section and $USE_NODES is not set don't split by node.
This behaviour and the previous aren't documented, so it could change
in the future.
@end itemize
@item API changes between 1.76 and 1.78: 
@itemize @bullet
@item paragraph has new arguments
with indentation information, added as the third argument, and
other context information. The formatting linked with commands
opened before the paragraph and closed after the paragraph are done
in the formatting function. Similar
things are done for preformatted.
@item normal_text 
changed completely. There
are much more arguments to give informations about the context, and
normal_text now does more text manipulation. 
@item New arguments for image the alt text, the height and width, 
the path to working dir and the path to image file relative 
to working dir. More image formatting is
done in the formatting function.
@item New argument for empty_line.
@item End of line removal is done in formatting function of definition line
formatting.
@item node_file_name now should only returns the node file, since the 
redirection file isn't used anymore. element_file_name only is used for 
file names, whatever NODES_FILES is.
@end itemize
@item changes between 1.66 and 1.68:
@itemize @bullet
@item When the manual is split the default is to put resulting files in 
a directory with name the manual file basename (previously they were left in
 the current directory). To avoid that, call texi2html with 
@option{-output .}. This has been changed to be compatible with 
@command{makeinfo} and also because it fits better with the cross
manuals reference scheme.
@item The option @option{--output} signification changed. It now
has the same meaning than for @command{makeinfo}. It seems
that in 1.66 it was the same than @option{-out-file}. 
@option{--output} new meaning allows to replace @option{-out-file} and 
@option{-subdir} with a unique option. 

More precisely @option{-out-file} forces the output to be unsplit 
while @option{--output} behaves differently when split (it specifies
the directory
where the manual files should be outputted) and unsplit (it specifies
the output file). @option{-subdir} is retained for backward compatibility.

If you want a backward compatibility you can use @option{-subdir} 
for the output directory if the document is split, and @option{-out-file}
if the document isn't split. This hasn't been tested extensively though.
@item Many options has been obsoleted but they are retained for
backward compatibility.
@item The init files are searched in new directories, however they 
are still searched for in the old directories for backward
compatibility.
@item the option @option{--glossary} doesn't do anything. Likely
nothing specific is done regarding bibliographies. This has been
decided because this added some semantics to the texinfo formatting 
language that weren't part of texinfo. 

It should be possible to do
something similar with macros. See for example @file{glossary.texi} 
for glossary and @file{my-bib-macros.texi} for bibliography
in the directory @file{examples}. In the web2c package there is
an example of use of BibTeX, see @url{http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Build/source/TeX/texk/web2c/doc/} (the examples for bibliography are taken from the
texinfo home page @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/texinfo.html}).
@item don't use @code{T2H_CENTER_IMAGE}. @code{@@center} should be used
insead, it will give the right output for all the formats.
@item If a directory creation fails the program aborts. This is much safer.
@item The interface for internationalisation changed, although
the previous wasn't documented a lot.
@item the API described in this manual changed a lot. A important
change was to use the @code{Texi2HTML::Config} names space instead of
variables prefixed with @samp{T2H_} or  @samp{t2h_}. To cope with
the change the prefix should be removed from variables in init files.
Some variables are now in @code{%Texi2HTML::THISDOC}.
@item @code{@@ifinfo} regions are not expanded by default. This may lead
to warnings or errors especially if the Top node is enclosed in 
@code{@@ifinfo}, as some node won't appear in menus. The quick fix
is to call @command{texi2html} with the option @option{--ifinfo} and
the right way should be to make more use of @code{@@ifnottex}.
@item The code appearing before the first node is now outputted, it was
ignored before. @option{--ignore-preamble-text} revert to the previous
behaviour. Enclosing in @code{@@ifnothtml} would be much cleaner.

@cindex Specification of Info format
@cindex Definition of Info format

Here we describe the technical details of the Info format.

This format definition was written some 25 years after the Info format
was first devised.  So in the event of conflicts between this
definition and actual practice, practice wins.  It also assumes some
general knowledge of Texinfo; it is meant to be a guide for
implementors rather than a rigid technical standard.  We often refer
back to other parts of this manual for examples and definitions,
rather than redundantly spelling out every detail.

In this formal description, the characters @code{<>*()|=#} are used
for the language of the description itself.  Other characters are
literal.  The formal constructs used are typical: @code{<...>}
indicates a metavariable name, @samp{=} means definition, @samp{*}
repetition, @samp{?} optional, @samp{()} grouping, @samp{|}
alternation, @samp{#} comment.  Exception: @samp{*} at the beginning
of a line is literal.

We specify literal parentheses (those that are part of the Info
format) with @t{<lparen>} and @t{<rparen>}, meaning the single
characters @samp{(} and @samp{)} respectively.

Finally, the two-character sequence @samp{^@var{x}} means the single
character @samp{CTRL-@var{x}}, for any @var{x}.

@node Info Format Whole Manual
@subsection Info Format: A Whole Manual

@cindex Nonsplit manuals, Info format of
@cindex Split manuals, Info format of
@cindex Whole manual, in Info format

To begin, an Info manual is either @dfn{nonsplit} (contained wholly
within a single file) or @dfn{split} (across several files).

The syntax for a nonsplit manual is:

@example
    <nonsplit info file> =
<preamble>
<node>*
<tag table>
(<local variables>)?
@end example

When split, there is a @dfn{main file}, which contains only pointers
to the nodes given in other @dfn{subfiles}.  The main file looks
like this:

@example
    <split info main file> =
<preamble>
<indirect table>
<tag table>
(<local variables>)?
@end example

The subfiles in a split manual have the following syntax:

@example
    <split info subfile> =
<preamble>
<node>* 
@end example


@node Info Format Preamble
@subsection Info Format: Preamble

@cindex Preamble, in Info format

The @t{<preamble>} is text at the beginning of all output files.
It is not intended to be visible by default in an Info viewer, but
may be displayed upon user request.

@example
    <preamble> =
<identification>       # "This is FILENAME, produced by ..."
<copying text>         # Expansion of @@copying text.
<dir entries>          # Derived from @@dircategory and @@direntry.
@end example

These pieces are:

@table @t
@item <identification line>
An arbitrary string beginning the output file, followed by a blank
line.

@item <copying text>
The expansion of a @code{@@copying} environment, if
the manual has one (@pxref{copying}).

@item <dir entries>
The result of any @code{@@dircategory} and @code{@@direntry}
commands present in the manual (@pxref{Installing Dir Entries}).

@end table


@node Info Format Indirect Tag Table
@subheading Info Format: Indirect Tag Table

@cindex Indirect tag table, in Info format

The indirect table is written to the main file in the case of split
output only.  It specifies the starting byte position of each split
output file (as a decimal integer):

@example
    <indirect table> =
^_
Indirect:
(<filename>: <bytepos>)*
@end example

The number of preamble bytes written to each output file is included
in the positions.  Neither the preamble nor the size of the top-level
output file is included.

The first actual node of content will be pointed to by the first
entry.

Unfortunately, Info-creating programs such as @code{makeinfo} have not
always implemented these rules perfectly, due to various bugs and
oversights.  Therefore, robust Info viewers should fall back to
searching ``nearby'' the given position for a node, instead of just
giving up if the position is not perfectly at a node beginning.

As an example, suppose split output is generated for the GDB manual.
The top-level file @file{gdb.info} will contain something like this:

@example
^_
Indirect:
gdb.info-1: 1878
gdb.info-2: 295733
...
@end example

This tells Info viewers that the first node of the manual occurs at
byte 1878 (i.e., after the preamble) of the file @file{gdb.info-1}.
The first node written to @file{gdb.info-2} would start at byte 295733
if the subsequent @file{gdb.info-*} files (not including
@file{gdb.info} files were appended to @file{gdb.info-1}, including
their preambles.


@node Info Format Tag Table
@subheading Info Format: Tag Table

@cindex Tag table, in Info format

The tag table specifies the starting byte position of each node and anchor
in the file.  It is written in the main output file only, not (in the
case of split output) any subfiles.
 
@example
    <tag table> =
^_
Tag Table:
<lparen>Indirect<rparen> # this line appears in split output only
(Node|Ref): <nodeid>^?<bytepos>
^_
End Tag Table
@end example

The @samp{(Indirect)} line is the next line after @samp{Tag Table:}
in the case of split output only.  In this 

Each following line defines an identifier as either an anchor or a
node, as specific.  It is an error to define the same identifier both
ways.  For example, @samp{Node: Top^?1647} says that the node named
@samp{Top} starts at byte 1647 while @samp{Ref:
Overview-Footnote-1^?30045} says that the anchor named
@samp{Overview-Footnote-1} starts at byte 30045.

In the case of nonsplit output, the byte positions simply refer to the
location in the output file.  In the case of split output, the byte
positions refer to an imaginary file created by concatenating all the
split files (but not the top-level file).  See the previous section.

Here is an example:

@example
^_
Tag Table:
Node: Top^_89
Node: Ch1^_292
^_
End Tag Table
@end example

This specifies a manual with two nodes, `Top' and `Ch1', at byte
positions 89 and 292 respectively.  Because the @samp{(Indirect)} line
is not present, the manual is not split.


@node Info Format Local Variables
@subheading Info Format: Local Variables

@cindex Local variable section, in Info format

The local variables section is optional and is currently used to give the 
encoding information.  It may be augmented in the future.

@example
    <local variables> =
^_
Local Variables:
coding: <encoding>
End:
@end example

@xref{documentencoding,, @code{@@documentencoding}}.


@node Info Format Regular Nodes
@subheading Info Format: Regular Nodes

@cindex Info nodes, in Info format

Regular nodes look like this:

@example
    <node> =
^_
File: <fn>, Node: <id1>, (Next: <id2>, )? (Prev: <id3>, )? Up: <id4>

<general text, until the next ^_ or end-of-file>
@end example

The @code{Next} and @code{Prev} pointers are optional.  The @code{Up}
pointer may technically also be absent, although this is most likely the
case of a wrongly-structured Info manual.  At least one space must be
present after each colon and comma, but any number of spaces are
ignored.

This @t{<node>} defines @t{<id1>} in file @t{<fn>}, which is typically
just @samp{manualname} or perhaps @samp{manualname.info}.  Each of the
other references @t{<id2>}, @t{<id3>}, and @t{<id4>} must be defined
with either @samp{Node} or @samp{Ref} in the @t{<tag table>}.

Conventionally the nodes are arranged to form a tree, but this is not
a requirement of the format.  Each pointer can refer to any defined
identifier.

Identifiers cannot include periods, commas, colons or parentheses
(including @@-commands which produce any of these); these can confuse 
Info readers.  @xref{Node Line Requirements}.

The @t{<general text>} of the node can include the special constructs
described next.


@node Info Format Text Constructs
@section Info Format Text Constructs

@cindex Info format text constructs
@cindex text constructs, Info format

These special Info constructs can appear within the text of a node.

@menu
* Menu: Info Format Menu.
* Image: Info Format Image.
* Printindex: Info Format Printindex.
* Cross-reference: Info Format Cross-reference.
@end menu


@node Info Format Menu
@subsection Info Format: Menu

@cindex Menus, in Info format

Conventionally menus appear at the end of nodes, but the Info format
places no restrictions on their location.

@example
    <menu> =
* Menu:
(<menu entry> | <menu comment>)*
@end example

The parts of a @t{<menu entry>} are described in @ref{Menu Parts}.

A @t{<menu comment>} is any line not beginning with @samp{*} that
appears either at the beginning of the menu or is separated from a
menu entry by one or more blank lines.  These comments are intended to
be displayed as part of the menu, as-is (@pxref{Writing a Menu}).


@node Info Format Image
@subsection Info Format: Image

@cindex Images, in Info format

The @code{@@image} command results in the following special directive
within the Info file (@pxref{Images}):

@example
    <image> =
^@@^H[image src="<image file>"
            (text="<txt file contents>")?
            (alt="<alt text>")?
^@@^H]
@end example

The line breaks and indentation in this description are editorial; the
whitespace between the different parts of the directive in Info files
is arbitrary.

In the string @t{<image file>}, @t{<txt file contents>} and @t{<alt
text>}, @samp{"} is quoted as @samp{\"} and @samp{\} is quoted as
@samp{\\}.  The text and alt specifications are optional.

The @t{alt} value serves the same purpose as in HTML: A prose
description of the image.  In text-only displays or speech systems,
for example, the @t{alt} value may be used instead of displaying the
(typically graphical) @t{<image file>}.

The @t{<txt file contents>}, if present, should be taken as an ASCII
representation of the image, and also may be used on a text-only
display.

The format does not prescribe the choice between displaying the
@t{<image file>}, the @t{<alt text>} or @t{<txt file contents>}.


@node Info Format Printindex
@subsection Info Format: Printindex

@cindex Indexes, in Info format

Indexes in Info format are generally written as a menu
(@pxref{Indices}), but with an additional directive at the beginning
marking this as an index node:

@example
    <printindex> = 
^@@^H[index^@@^H]
* Menu:

<index entry>*
@end example

The @t{<index entry>} items are similar to normal menu entries, but
the free-format description is replaced by the line number of where
the entries occurs in the text:

@example
    <index entry> = 
* <entry text>: <entry node>. <lparen>line <lineno><rparen>
@end example

@noindent
The @t{<entry text>} is the index term.  The @t{<lineno>} is an
unsigned integer, given relative to the start of the @t{<entry node>}.
There may be arbitrary whitespace after the colon and period, as usual
in menus.  Here is an example:

@example
^@@^H[index^@@^H]
* Menu:

* thunder:           Weather Phenomena.             (line 5)
@end example

This means that an index entry for `thunder' appears at line 5 of the
node `Weather Phenomena'.


@node Info Format Cross-reference
@subsection Info Format: Cross-reference

@cindex Cross-references, in Info format

A general cross reference in Info format is written as follows:

@example
    <cross-reference> =
* (N|n)ote (<id>:: | <label>:(<lparen><infofile><rparen>)?<id>(.|,))
@end example

Whether @samp{note} or @samp{Note} is used is not significant.

The @samp{<id>::} form indicates a node or anchor reference within the
current manual.

The longer form indicates a general reference, typically used to refer
to a node or anchor in a different manual, but possibly to the current
manual.  The @t{<label>} is descriptive text; the optional
@samp{(<infofile>)} is the filename of the manual being referenced,
and the @t{<id>} is the node or anchor within that manual, terminated
by a comma or period.  That final punctuation is part of the
surrounding sentence, and should be displayed.

Here are some examples:

@example
*note GNU Free Documentation License::
*note Tag table: Info Format Tag Table, for details.
*Note Overview: (make)Top.
@end example

The first shows the short form, a reference to a node in the current
manual.

The second also refers to a node in the current manual, namely `Info
Format Tag Table'; the `Tag table' before the @samp{:} is only a label
on this particular reference.

The third example refers to the node `Top' in another manual, namely
@samp{make}, with `Overview' being the label for this cross-reference.

@xref{Cross References}.


@c The simple description in the command summary seems sufficient to me
@c these days, so ignore this appendix.  --karl, 13mar04.

@c @cindex Paragraphs, filling
@c @findex refill
@c 
@c The @code{@@refill} command refills and, optionally, indents the first
@c line of a paragraph.@footnote{Perhaps the command should have been
@c called the @code{@@refillandindent} command, but @code{@@refill} is
@c shorter and the name was chosen before indenting was possible.} The
@c @code{@@refill} command is no longer important, but we describe it here
@c because you once needed it.  You will see it in many old Texinfo
@c files.@refill
@c 
@c Without refilling, paragraphs containing long @@-constructs may look
@c bad after formatting because the formatter removes @@-commands and
@c shortens some lines more than others.  In the past, neither the
@c @code{texinfo-format-region} command nor the
@c @code{texinfo-format-buffer} command refilled paragraphs
@c automatically.  The @code{@@refill} command had to be written at the
@c end of every paragraph to cause these formatters to fill them.  (Both
@c @TeX{} and @code{makeinfo} have always refilled paragraphs
@c automatically.)  Now, all the Info formatters automatically fill and
@c indent those paragraphs that need to be filled and indented.@refill
@c 
@c The @code{@@refill} command causes @code{texinfo-format-region} and
@c @code{texinfo-format-buffer} to refill a paragraph in the Info file
@c @emph{after} all the other processing has been done.  For this reason,
@c you can not use @code{@@refill} with a paragraph containing either
@c @code{@@*} or @code{@@w@{ @dots{} @}} since the refilling action will
@c override those two commands.@refill
@c 
@c The @code{texinfo-format-region} and @code{texinfo-format-buffer}
@c commands now automatically append @code{@@refill} to the end of each
@c paragraph that should be filled.  They do not append @code{@@refill} to
@c the ends of paragraphs that contain @code{@@*} or @w{@code{@@w@{ @dots{}@}}}
@c and therefore do not refill or indent them.@refill

@c are all given elsewhere anyway.  So ignore the entire appendix.
