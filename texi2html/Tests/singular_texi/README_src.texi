@majorheading Welcome to the Source FTP site of SINGULAR

@sc{Singular} is a Computer Algebra system for polynomial computations
with special emphasize on the needs of commutative algebra, algebraic
geometry, singularity theory and polynomial system solving. For a more
detailed overview of
@sc{Singular}, see
@display
@uref{http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Overview/}
@end display

So far, there are only version for Linux, HPUX, SunOS, IRIX, AIX, FreeBSD 4.2,
MacOS X, MacOS 9, and Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2K/XP.

In this directory you find the following files:

license information for @sc{Singular}
@item @code{Singular-@value{VERSION}-<package>.tar.gz}
@sc{Singular} distribution archive which contains the package @code{<package>}
@item @code{omalloc.tar.gz}

@heading Compiling SINGULAR for a Unix platform

Make sure that you have approximately 120 MByte of free disk space and
follow these steps.

@enumerate
@item
Make sure that you have the following software (the list may be incomplete):
  @enumerate
  @item
  general unix utilities: grep, test, sed, cp, mv, gzip, uudecode, ...
  @item
  autoconf
  @item
  gnu-make
  @item
  gcc, g++ (version 2.7.2 preferred,
  but gcc version 2.6.3 to 2.95.3, egcs 1.0.3 and 1.1.2 should work,
  gcc 2.96 does not work)
  @item
  bison (version >= 1.2.2)
  @item
  flex (version >=2.4)
  @item
  perl (version >=5)
  @item
  library gmp (version 3.x.x)
  @item
  (optional) library libreadline
  @item
  (optional, required to build the documentation:)
  latex2html, tex, texi2html, texinfo
  @* (your latex2html should produce gif files, not png files)
  @end enumerate
@item
(optional, required for MP:)
@*make sure that you can log in to your computer via rsh/remsh
or ssh without a password (check .rhosts/.shosts);
otherwise the configure script stops while checking this:
if you cannot fix it, simply kill the rsh/ssh-processes
- the configure will then disable this particulare feature
@*The following is tested by configure
@*rsh localhost uname
@*ssh localhost uname
@*rsh `hostname` uname
@*ssh `hostname` uname
@item
You need to download all of the .tar.gz-files
@item
create a new working directory
@item
unpack all packages into that working directory
@item
(optional, for porting to a unknown machine:)
fix ./singuname.sh not to report something unknown, but to recognize the machine
@item
run ./configure
@*(try ./configure --help, ./omalloc/configure --help, ./MP/configure --help,
./factory/configure --help, ./Singular/configure --help for a list of
all options of configure)
@item
make install (resp. gmake install - the make program must be GNU-Make)
the make process will (hopefully) build:
  @enumerate
  @item
  omalloc: the memry management routines (required)
  @item
  MP: Multi-Protocoll (optional)
  @item
  factory (optional, but strongly recommended)
  @item
  libfac (optional, but strongly recommended)
  @item
  Singular (Kernel, required)
  @item
  doc (only possible, if all optional packages are included)
  @item
  emacs (only possible, if doc was build)
  @item
  IntegerProgramming
  @item
  misc
  @end enumerate
@item
if you want to make any change in the directory Singular,
run make depend there
@item
to install the resulting files at any other place in the system,
run
@*      make bindist sharedist
@*(sharedist can only be build if doc was build sucessfully)
and install the resulting .tar.gz files as explained
for the binary distribution
@item
if you compiled Singular for a non-standard architecture and
you are willing to share your porting effort,
upload the changed sources and the resulting binaries to
@code{ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Incoming}
and send us an email about it (Singular@@mathematik.uni-kl.de)
@item
bug-fixes or other improvements to the source code are welcome
@end enumerate

@heading Notes for specific platforms
@itemize @asis
@item Windows (Cygwin):@*
./configure --with-malloc=system
@item MacOS X:@*
you need a file values.h where MP can find it (we copied one from Linux)@*
./configure --with-malloc=system
@item DecAlpha/Linux:@*
egcs-1.1.2 does not work, but gcc version 2.95.2 does@*
./configure --without-MP
@item FreeBSD 4.2:@*
you need a file values.h where MP can find it (we copied one from Linux)@*
./configure --with-malloc=system
