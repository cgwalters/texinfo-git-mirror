<h1>Footnotes</h1>
<h3><a name="FOOT1" href="texinfo_2.html#DOCF1">(1)</a></h3>
<p>The first syllable of &quot;Texinfo&quot; is pronounced
like &quot;speck&quot;, not &quot;hex&quot;.  This odd pronunciation is derived from,
but is not the same as, the pronunciation of TeX.  In the word
TeX, the `<samp>X</samp>' is actually the Greek letter &quot;chi&quot; rather than
the English letter &quot;ex&quot;.  Pronounce TeX as if the `<samp>X</samp>' were the
last sound in the name `Bach'; but pronounce Texinfo as if the `<samp>x</samp>'
were a `k'.  Spell &quot;Texinfo&quot; with a capital &quot;T&quot; and the other
letters in lower case.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT2" href="texinfo_2.html#DOCF2">(2)</a></h3>
<p>In some documents, the first child has no `Previous'
pointer.  Occasionally, the last child has the node name of the next
following higher level node as its `Next' pointer.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT3" href="texinfo_2.html#DOCF3">(3)</a></h3>
<p>You can also use the
<a name="IDX13"></a>
<a href="ftp://tug.org/texi2roff.tar.gz"><code>texi2roff</code></a> program if you
do not have TeX; since Texinfo is designed for use with TeX,
<code>texi2roff</code> is not described here.  <code>texi2roff</code> is not part of
the standard GNU distribution and is not maintained or up-to-date with
all the Texinfo features described in this manual.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT4" href="texinfo_2.html#DOCF4">(4)</a></h3>
<p>The word
<em>argument</em> comes from the way it is used in mathematics and does not
refer to a dispute between two people; it refers to the information
presented to the command.  According to the <cite>Oxford English
Dictionary</cite>, the word derives from the Latin for <em>to make clear,
prove</em>; thus it came to mean `the evidence offered as proof', which is
to say, `the information offered', which led to its mathematical
meaning.  In its other thread of derivation, the word came to mean `to
assert in a manner against which others may make counter assertions',
which led to the meaning of `argument' as a dispute.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT5" href="texinfo_4.html#DOCF5">(5)</a></h3>
<p>We have found
that it is helpful to refer to versions of independent manuals as
`editions' and versions of programs as `versions'; otherwise, we find we
are liable to confuse each other in conversation by referring to both
the documentation and the software with the same words.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT6" href="texinfo_8.html#DOCF6">(6)</a></h3>
<p>Menus can
carry you to any node, regardless of the hierarchical structure; even to
nodes in a different Info file.  However, the GNU Emacs Texinfo mode
updating commands work only to create menus of subordinate nodes.
Conventionally, cross references are used to refer to other nodes.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT7" href="texinfo_11.html#DOCF7">(7)</a></h3>
<p>It would be straightforward to extend Texinfo to work
in a similar fashion for C, Fortran, or other languages.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT8" href="texinfo_14.html#DOCF8">(8)</a></h3>
<p>A footnote should complement or expand upon
the primary text, but a reader should not need to read a footnote to
understand the primary text.  For a thorough discussion of footnotes,
see <cite>The Chicago Manual of Style</cite>, which is published by the
University of Chicago Press.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT9" href="texinfo_14.html#DOCF9">(9)</a></h3>
<p>Here
is the sample footnote.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT10" href="texinfo_20.html#DOCF10">(10)</a></h3>
<p>Note the use
of the `<samp>;</samp>' character, instead of `<samp>:</samp>', as directory separator
on these systems.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT11" href="texinfo_21.html#DOCF11">(11)</a></h3>
<p>On MS-DOS/MS-Windows systems, Info will
try the `<tt>.inf</tt>' extension as well.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT12" href="texinfo_21.html#DOCF12">(12)</a></h3>
<p>Note the
use of `<samp>;</samp>' as the directory separator, and a different syntax for
using values of other environment variables.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT13" href="texinfo_21.html#DOCF13">(13)</a></h3>
<p>On MS-DOS/MS-Windows systems, use semi-colon instead.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT14" href="texinfo_28.html#DOCF14">(14)</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps the command should have been
called the <code>@refillandindent</code> command, but <code>@refill</code> is
shorter and the name was chosen before indenting was possible.
