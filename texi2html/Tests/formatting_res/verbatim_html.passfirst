A list with bullet
Before itemize, in that case @@bullet isn'right, one needs @@bullet@{@} (in info) @itemize @bullet{} @item on the same line than item
some text
@item
more text @end itemize

A list with text before first @@item:

@itemize @bullet
text @item more
text
@end itemize

a verbatim, not first on the line @verbatim text following @verbatim

text


@@@@ @ text before @end  verbatim @end verbatim Text following end verbatim, must be exactly one space 
between end and verbatim. @@end verbatim doesn't need to begin at beginning 
of line.

In tex, @@end verbatim must be on its own on a line.

A verbatim with begin and end on its own line
@verbatim
verbatim @samp{item}

@end verbatim


Now html  @html 
<b>
some html </b> 
@end html bidule ignored

@@end html begins the line, and there must be exactly one space between @@end
and html and thing following @@end html are ignored in info. Strangely
the empty line following @@end html is ignored but spaces are inserted.

Now html valid for @TeX{}  @html 
<b>
some html </b> 
@end html
Some text one the line following @@end html

And html on it's own line

@html
<tt> an html tt</tt>
@end html


A sc: @sc{ieee}, and another one in example:
@example
@sc{aeei}
@end example

ignore bidule ignore

Ignore is the same than @@html.

Now ifnothtml on same line 
@@end ifnothtml doesn't need to begin the line, and there can be more
than one space between @@end and ifnothtml, but nothing more
on the line.

Text on the line before ifnothtml with text following,
Text on the line following ifnothtml.

Text on the line before ifnothtml without text following,
Text on the line following ifnothtml.

Text on the line before ifnothtml,
Text on the line following empty ifnothtml


@TeX{} has problems with the ftable.

an ftable on same line @ftable @bullet
@item fun1
@itemx fun2
fun1 et fun2 @item more fun
text on the same line than end   @end ftable
works like @@ifnothtml

@item outside format.

@tab outside format.

@multitable {@samp{bidule}}
truc before table beginning @item first cell @tab ignored cell
@itemx second row
@end multitable

before bad  multitable @multitable 6 7
@item 1-1 @tab 1-2 @item@tab@item 3-1 @tab 3-2 @end multitable

right multitable
@multitable @columnfractions 6 7
@item 1-1 @tab 1-2 @item@tab@item 3-1 @tab 3-2 @end multitable

multitable beginning with @@tab
@multitable {@samp{@verb{.something.}}} {sec}
@tab after first tab 
@item new line
@end multitable

A flushright
@flushright some text flushed right
@end flushright

A center @center Centered line
And a center after empty line

@center centered line after empty line

And a center at end of line @center
And an empty center @center   

An empty flushright @flushright

@end flushright

A verb follows:

@verb{' a little

very little
verb '}

another with space as delimiter

@verb{ what@@ }

@@verb followed by end of line seems incorrect.
Now verb delimited with *, with an empty line, a comment and @@samp:

@verb{*with
verb @c comment

and samp @samp{text }
*}



@node node @'{a}, node d@'a, First node, Top
@chapter node 'a with braces
In the node with braces

A footnote with an empty line within.
@footnote{with empty line

before before} 

Now a ref with a footnote within, there aren't 2 paragraphes in the footnote
in that case in info. tex doesn't like the paragraph break in the ref
@ref{First 
node, within ref a footnote @footnote{with empty line

before before}}.

Conversely, a ref in a footnote
@footnote{ This is a ref @ref{First node} }

A footnote with an example
@footnote{
@example


An example

@end example
}


Some @@verbatim, @@verb and @@ignore within an xref, very hard for @TeX{}:
@xref{First node, 
@verbatim

some
verbatim   @@
text
within an xref

@end verbatim


and now verb delimited with * with an empty line a comment and @@samp
@verb{*with
verb @c comment

and samp @samp{text }
next line
*}

last ignored sentence

}.

@xref{First node,
no verb}.

@node node d@'a,, node @'{a}, Top
@chapter node 'a without braces
@menu

@node node,,,

A node with gggggggg
