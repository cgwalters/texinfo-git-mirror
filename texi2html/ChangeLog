2003-04-02  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>
	* texi2html.pl: macros splitted by 3 paragraphs are better handled.
	more isolation of formatting.
	better generation of index keys from commands, with more macros
	replaced by the right letter or symbol.
	better handling of @things{} in preformatted sections.
	preformatted sections handled with a new format, preformatted (similar
	with what is done for paragraphs). Some validation errors avoided.
	commands for tables are handled.
	index entries have the right file/id from their place.
	The files are omitted from hrefs when the href points to the same file.
	* Tests/*: formatting/imbrications.texi added. Sync with code.

2003-03-27  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: rewrite of the parsing of texi
	and of the handling of sectionning.
	pass0 is now pass_texi. It still only generates texinfo.
	pass_texi now also collects informations from sectionning commands
	index entries, printindex commands.
	pass1 through pass4 are now in just one pass, pass_text.
	between pass_texi and pass_text, the information is used to figure
	out the document and indices structure.
	pass_text reparses the texinfo generated by pass_texi and
	produces html. All the formatting is done in isolated subroutines
	such that it is easy to change the formatting witout bothering
	with the parsing.
	pass_text uses scan_line to process a line.
	A stack is used which holds opened macros and formats. Thus the 
	html is always closed and should be valid.
	The document structure seems right with this approach, unnumbered 
	sections are at the right level and indices don't break the document
	structure anymore.
	* Tests/*: more tests for the @macros. Other minor modifications.
	sync with new code.
2003-03-06  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>
	* T2h_i18n.pm: added  the licence
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, check_texinfo.pl.in: check function
	put in check_texinfo.pl.in. T2H_EXPAND is now an array such that
	more than one type may be expanded
	* texi2html.pl: added a new pass before the other ones, pass0 and
	a function scan_line0 used in that pass. During that pass the
	ifhtml, ifnot*, the comments and multiple empty lines, the macros, 
	values and includes are handled. No html is generated. the
	different things that are expanded can now be within a line and 
	not necessarily at the begining of the line.
	The handling of values and macros is not changed.
	scan_line handles more constructs (newlines (still bugged), 
	verbatim, html and tex, deffn (incomplete)).
	new function close_stack which might be used to close the things 
	forgotten by users or between paragraphs.
	new function substitute_text which uses scan_line to render
	arbitrary text.
	little improvements in menu comments handling.
	accent_map/do_accent should handle all the accents.
	* Tests/test.sh: minor changes.
	* Tests/*: regenerated tests to keep in sync.
	added formatting/imbrications.texi to test for imbricated things.
	* configure, configure.in: added check_texinfo.pl.in.

2003-02-28  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, T2h_i18n.pm: options specifications
	moved from texi2html.init to texi2html.pl, such that texi2html.init
	resembles a regular user init file. internationalization move
	from texi2html.init to T2h_i18n.pm. 
	* configure.in: added substitution of T2h_i18n.pm within 
	texi2html.pl
	* configure, doc/Makefile.in, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, 
	Tests/Makefile.in: regenerated with automake-1.6.3, autoconf-2.53

2003-02-24  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>
	* Tests: small fixes, more tests showing brokeness of texi2html
	for some features and info and tex differences. 
	A change in texinfo.txi to permit handling of verb despite some 
	substitutions have allready been done
	* texi2html.pl: add comment about the formats in texinfo 4.5
	setlocale is used in case of tests to avoid change in ordering of 
	indices while testing against a reference file
	footnotes refs and image handled by parse_line, which calls a 
        sub routine (do_footnote, do_ref or do_image).
        for footnotes, _$doc_num instead of $docu_doc
	appended tp keep track of the file of the footnote, such that it 
	is easier to match. 
	instead of <!--::${section}::--> added before printindex, _$sec_num 
	is appended to printindex, to keep track of the
	section number.
        images extention is taken from the @image tag if available
        everything which was splitted accross pass2, pass3 and pass4 is
        now done in pass2.
        in pass3 only very little cleaning is done, pass4 is removed.
        
2003-02-21  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>
	* texi2html.pl: added handling of overbar accent @= is transformed
	in =
	the handling of multi lines macro is done in a function, scan_line
	which scans a line, keeping a record of the text allready ready,
	the macro stack and a state which for now only contains 'verb' if in
	@verb macro. The @verb macro is handled by this function (but since
	things have allready been substituted, it cannot give the right 
	result easily)

2003-02-19  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: T2H_DEFAULT_button_icon_img behaves
	better when it has some undef arguments
	the variables which may be redefined by the user are now global. 
	They are grouped in texi2html.init, and also in the Declaration in 
	texi2html.pl and sorted by class.
	new elements in %T2H_THISDOC for items which are global but shouldn't
	be redefined by the user (instead of $T2H_HOMEPAGE, $THISPROG...).
	t2h_Init_global has been removed and the code scattered according to
	the principles above
	other minor fixes

2003-02-18  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>
	* texi2html.pl: handle @verbatim, and @html differently. Added 
	push_until function which shift from a lines array and push to another 
	array until @end tag. Remove PROTECTTAG
	remove unneeded push of index entry for vtable or ftable which
	created 2 indices entry
	* Tests: added more tests

2003-02-13  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: avoid using $_ in functions, as it is a global
	variable, use my variables instead
	* Tests/test.sh: if called with arguments, the test specified by 
	the arguments is the only one done
	* Tests/*: add Makefile.in, more subdirectories, synchronise
	reference files with changes in the code

2003-02-12  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: add prototype for the functions ; remove

2003-02-11  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: unused variables removed
	use_bibliography removed, lots of global variables made lexical.
	open renamed open_file to avoid clashing with perl builtin.
	remove sub init_input, the initialization is done in the 
	script itself.
	add meta http-equiv="Content-Type" tag for the charset
 	declaration.

2003-02-06  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: some unused variables removed
	use_acc not used anymore, accents are always handled
	Remove a lot of global variables. Use global lexical or lexically
	scoped variables (with my) when possible. Pass variables as arguments
	when the function is in texi2html.init
	bugfixes: frame target is the top file, and not the toc file
	during pass1 some lines where pushed in @lines2 instead of @lines
	* Tests/test.sh: ignore CVS directory when doing diffs

2003-02-03  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: Remove handling of setref which is a TeX macro. The

	* configure.in, Makefile.am, Tests/test.sh, Tests/Makefile.am Tests/*:
	Files used for testing added, texinfo manuals and the html results for 
	some of the texinfo manuals

2003-01-30  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: fix nesting of multi line style macros (previously,
	@kbd{@code{my
	thing}}
	became
	<kbd>my thing<kbd><code></code> (or something approaching)
	no style substitution is done in indexes (indexes are already good
	html). Added %sec2index which is undef for a section name not in index,
	1 if the section name is in index.
	the value of $docu_doc set if $T2H_OUT was set (option -o) wasn't 
	used to define docu_doc_file, thus the output file was the basename 
	of the texinfo file with extension appended, and not $T2H_OUT.


2003-01-28  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: fixes in the handling of characters which are

	is handled
	Cedilla are now accepted in node names. Added protect_cedilla and
	unprotect_cedilla functions.
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: Add -test option which sets 
	$T2H_TODAY $T2H_USER $THISPROG to given values. This is in order 
	to be able to compare with reference files for testing purproses.

2003-01-16  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: @H{a} is changed in a'' and not &aacute; which was

	* texi2html.init ($T2H_DOCTYPE): Add SystemLiteral to identify the
	canonical DTD.
	* texi2html.init (T2H_DEFAULT_about_body): Fix HTML syntax of
	Subsubsection One-Two-Three example.
	* texi2html.pl: Close HTML <p> before HTML <table> and HTML
	<dl>.  Correct handling of texinfo menu comment lines.
	* texi2html.pl (protect_html): Simplify.  This subroutine was way
	too smart!  Use Character entity references (eg &lt;) instead of
	Numeric character references (eg. &#60).
	* texi2html.pl (unprotect_html): Use Character entity references
	(eg &lt;) instead of Numeric character references (eg. &#60).

2000-09-14  Eric Sunshine  <sunshine@sunshineco.com>

	* doc/Makefile.in: Added missing doc/Makefile.in since its absence
	  caused 'configure' and make targets (such as 'distclean') to bomb.

2000-09-14  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* applied patches/fixes from  Eric Marsden <emarsden@mail.dotcom.fr>.
	  o DTD now at the beginning of the document
	  o default language to 'en' wasn't working which led to empty LANG=""
	    in <BODY>
	  o missing </FONT> in footer blurb
	  o when the ToC was generated in some cases, the code used
	    <UL></UL> to indent, but didn't have any <LI> tags.  <blockquote>
	    is now used in such cases, instead.

2000-09-11  Eric Sunshine  <sunshine@sunshineco.com>

	* texi2html.pl: Fixed severe macro expansion bug.  Macro argument
	  parsing code did not handle nested braces ('{' and '}') at
	  all, thus valid macro invocations such as
	  "@mymacro{Hello @emph{there} @strong{world}.}" would fail.
	  Prior to this fix, @mymacro would be handed the argument
	  "Hello @emph{there", which is clearly incorrect.  Now @mymacro
	  correctly receives "Hello @emph{there} @strong{world}." as its
	  argument.  This fix also deals properly with the protected brace
	  sequences \{, \}, @{, and @}.

	* texi2html.pl: Fixed severe macro expansion bug.  Macro argument
	  parsing code did not handle arguments split over multiple lines,
	  such as "@mymacro{Hello \n world.}".  Now it correctly handles
	  macro invocations split across any number of lines, and properly
	  flags an error at the correct location if the user forgets the
	  closing brace '}'.

	* texi2html.pl: Fixed formatting errors in expansions of @SPACE,
	  @TAB, and @NL (where SPACE, TAB, and NL represent the actual
	  space, tab, and newline characters).  The Texinfo manual
	  explicitly states that each of these sequences should expand to a
	  "printable" space in the [rendered] output.  The example given in
	  the manual shows that "Spacey@ @ @ @ example" should expand to
	  "Spacey    example".  However, texi2html was only emitting the
	  insignificant whitespace ' ' and '\n' into the HTML output which
	  did not properly preserve the hard spaces in "Spacey    example".
	  Now each of these directives expands to '&nbsp;' instead.

	* texi2html.pl: Made aesthetic improvement to the output of @file{},
	  @option{}, and @samp{}.  The argument string is now quoted with
	  ` and ' _after_ the style has been applied.  For instance,
	  @samp{perl} now expands to "`<samp>perl</samp>'", whereas it used
	  to expand to "<samp>`perl'</samp>".  In my tests, this change
	  results in more aesthetically pleasing rendered output on various
	  browsers.

2000-08-16  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: Bug fix from: "joseph" <joseph@freenet.de>
	MySimple.pm should be 'require'd, but checked is still texi2html.init.

2000-08-14  Karl Heinz Marbaise   <khmarbaise@gmx.de>
        * new command line switch (Test purposes only!)
          to show new layout in HTML for @def stuff.
        * Texinfo-Documentation updated.
          - New chapter about ``customizing HTML'' started.
          - multiple files instead of one.
          - subdirectory doc.

2000-07-27  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: Fixed Getopt::Long::Configure("pass_through") for
	older versions of Getopt::Long which do not support his function.

2000-07-11  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* implemented @documentlanguage:
	  - sets language of document, unless overwritten by -lang, or 
	    explicitly set $T2H_LANG

	* introduced T2H_OBSOLETE_OPTIONS to prevent obsolete options to 
	  ambiguate current options
	
2000-07-09  Karl Heinz Marbaise   <khmarbaise@gmx.de>
        * Texinfo-Documentation:
          - fixes from Peter Moulder <pjm@bofh.asn.au> incorporated
            into manual.
          - Updated Manual
            o improved
            o indices for options, variables of script.
            o much more.
        * texi2html.init:
          - improvements for different languages
            (month names, words in different languages).

2000-07-05  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* Provided CVS anonymous read-access to Texi2html:

2000-07-01  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* primitive support for some toher def stuff (needs to be fixed,
	though) 
	* Distribution: Incorporated texi2html.texi authored by Karl Heinz
	Marbaise <khmarbaise@gmx.de> (THANKS!)
	
	* texi2html.1.in: Updates to reflect new cmd-line options

	* Rewrote handling of command-line options:
	- based on (My)Simple.pm, and Getopt::Long
	-help now works and is up-to-date
	-help 1 lists also "not-so-important" options
	-help 2 lists also obsolete options
	- the following options were renamed: (old options still work, but 
	  are marked as obsolete)
	    verbose            ==> Verbose
	    section_navigation ==> sec_nav
	    output_file        ==> out_file
	- the following options are obsoleted (still work, though):
 	    no-section_navigation ==> -nosec_nav
	    use_acc		  ==> ALWAYS use accents
	    expandinfo		  ==> -expand info	
	    expandtex		  ==> -expand tex
	    no_verbose            ==> default case
	    monolithic            ==> default case
	    split_node            ==> -split section
	    split_chapter         ==> -split chapter
	
2000-06-27  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* Fixed bug in anchor generation (reported by various people who
	noticed that @anchor may not be on one line with @item)
	* Fixed infinite loop on missing '@end macro'
	* texi2html.pl: -expandinfo and -expandtex command-line options
	for backward compatibility

	* texi2html.init: Use ISO 639 language codes for keys in $T2H_LANG 
	hash.

2000-06-26  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: new command-line options:
	 -nonumber, -nomenu to unset the default -number -menu

	* texi2html.pl: As suggested by "Richard Y. Kim" <ryk@coho.net>:
	insert <A NAME="#nodename"></A> for each
	nodename in a document (nodename is exactly as in texinfo
	source). 
	
	* From: "Richard Y. Kim" <ryk@coho.net>
	  o $T2H_FRAMES internal boolean variable which defaults to 0
	  o -frames command line option which changes $T2H_FRAMES to 1.
	  o If $T2H_FRAMES is 1, then two additional files are output.
	    If mydoc.html is output normally, then mydoc_frame.html
	    and mydoc_frame_toc.html files are output.
	  o The functions T2H_print_frame, and T2H_print_toc_frame are used to
		generate contents of these files.
	  o The T2H_DEFAULT_print_frame and T2H_DEFAULT_print_toc_frame
	    (defined in texi2html.ini) do the following:
       mydoc_frame.html is the short file with <FRAME> tags.
       mydoc_frame_toc.html is basically the short table of contents
       which goes on the narrow left frame.
	
	* texi2html.pl: @,{c} --> &ccedil;

2000-06-23  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* released version 1.63
	* texi2html.init (T2H_DEFAULT_print_page_head):

	    o handle \} in macro arguments
	* from brlewis@alum.mit.edu:
	    o Changes to facilitate CSS
	    o -toc_file option for those who want the TOC to be index.html
	    o Config variable $T2H_HREF_DIR_INSTEAD_FILE:
	       if set (e.g., to index.html) replace hrefs to this file 
               (i.e., to index.html) by ./
	* texi2html.pl: index generation after value substitution

2000-05-31  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: for def_map stuff <A NAME=..> before output
	* texi2html.pl: applied patch from "Richard Y. Kim" <ryk@ap.com>
	                for @refs with 2 or 3 args: use 3rd or 2nd argor
			section (in that order) as text for reference.

2000-04-18  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* implemented @ftable, @vtable
	* index generation reimplemented: 
	  - Can be split over several pages, depending on the value of
	    $T2H_SPLIT_INDEX 
	  - typesetting in fixed-width font is observed
	* texi2html.init: T2H_IDX_SUMMARY either set or not set, takes no
	argument.

2000-04-08  Peter Moulder  <pjm@bofh.asn.au>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: Generate texi2html in
	configure script instead of Makefile.  (Due mostly to
	Teun Burgers.)

	* README, TODO, texi2html.1.in, texi2html.init, texi2html.pl:
	Misc. documentation changes.

2000-04-07  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* fixed bug in creation of index entries (eval of section names) 
	* fixed table within itemize and parapgraphs
	* surpress <P></P> when within <pre>
	* allow @include within top node

2000-04-03  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.init: By default, T2H_TOP_FILE is set to '' 
	* texi2html.pl: $docu_top=$T2H_TOP_FILE || $docu_name. $docu_ext;

2000-03-31  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: $complex_format_map for complex enclosing
	constructs where which: 
	* texi2html.init:$T2H_EXAMPLE_INDENT_CELL,
	$T2H_SMALL_EXAMPLE_INDENT_CELL, $T2H_SMALL_FONT_SIZE for
	customizing indent/font size of block-enclosing texinfo command
	(@example, @format, @display, etc).
	* Release version 1.61.

2000-03-29  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* Cleaned up texi2html.pl and added loading of init file (when
	texi2html.pl is run) such that it can directly be used as script
	(otherwise, debugging is much harder).

	* fixed getpwuid 

	* Added T2H_print_chapter_header, T2H_print_chapter_footer for
	more fine-grained control of T2H_SPLIT eq 'chapter', added option
	-section_navigation, $T2H_SECTION_NAVIGATION to suppress output of
	navigation panels per section

	* Changed naming and and calling convention of customizable subs:
	They all have prefix T2H_, are called with &$T2H_, are assigned by 
	$T2H_<name> = \&T2H_DEFAULT_<name>.

	* texi2html.init: Incorporated changed of Peter Moulder:
	
2000-03-27  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* debian/*: deleted
	* texi2html.pl: Incorporated changes of Peter Moulder
	* texi2html.pl: Automatic node pointer creation added
	* texi2html.pl: @enddots, @exclamdown, etc added

2000-03-26  Peter Moulder  <reiter@netspace.net.au>

	* texi2html.init: Address a couple of weblint/tidy warnings.

	* texi2html.init:
	* texi2html.pl: The init file is inserted into the executable at
	build time (see Makefile.am).

	* texi2html.pl: Source each of @sysconfdir@/texi2htmlrc and
	$HOME/.texi2htmlrc if it exists, after processing texi2html.init
	but before anything on the command-line.
	
	Allow -split_chapter, -split_node, -monolithic options, which is
	what previous versions of texi2html used.
	
	Support `@command{...}'.
	
	Add --help, --version options.
	
	-sidx isn't used, so comment out.

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.am:
	* autogen.sh: New files.

	* configure.in: Change version number from 1.60Beta to 1.59.2.

	* debian/*: New files.

	* texi2html.1.in:
	* texi2html.pl: Extract the man page into a separate file.  At the
	moment, the man page is even installed separately (with
	texi2html.pl having `.so @MANPAGE_PATH@' in place of the
	manpage).  Conceivably we could add a configure option to
	construct everything as one file like we used to; just replace
	that text with `@EMBEDDED_MANPAGE@', which would be replaced with
	either the existing `.so @MANPAGE_PATH@' or with texi2html.1
	contents the way texi2html.init is done.
	
2000-03-14  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: center @image by default, can be overwritten by
	T2H_CENTER_IMAGE (sunshine@sunshineco.com)

# vim:tabstop=8:shiftwidth=8
