<h1>Footnotes</h1>
<h3><a name="FOOT1" href="Overview.html#DOCF1">(1)</a></h3>
<p>The first syllable of &ldquo;Texinfo&rdquo; is pronounced
like &ldquo;speck&rdquo;, not &ldquo;hex&rdquo;.  This odd pronunciation is derived from,
but is not the same as, the pronunciation of TeX.  In the word
TeX, the &lsquo;<samp>X</samp>&rsquo; is actually the Greek letter &ldquo;chi&rdquo; rather than
the English letter &ldquo;ex&rdquo;.  Pronounce TeX as if the &lsquo;<samp>X</samp>&rsquo; were the
last sound in the name &lsquo;Bach&rsquo;; but pronounce Texinfo as if the &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;
were a &lsquo;k&rsquo;.  Spell &ldquo;Texinfo&rdquo; with a capital &ldquo;T&rdquo; and the other
letters in lower case.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT2" href="Info-Files.html#DOCF2">(2)</a></h3>
<p>In some documents, the first child has no &lsquo;Previous&rsquo;
pointer.  Occasionally, the last child has the node name of the next
following higher level node as its &lsquo;Next&rsquo; pointer.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT3" href="Printed-Books.html#DOCF3">(3)</a></h3>
<p>You can also use the
<a name="index-texi2roff_002c-unsupported-software"></a>
<a href="ftp://tug.org/texi2roff.tar.gz"><code>texi2roff</code></a> program if you
do not have TeX; since Texinfo is designed for use with TeX,
<code>texi2roff</code> is not described here.  <code>texi2roff</code> is not part of
the standard GNU distribution and is not maintained or up-to-date with
all the Texinfo features described in this manual.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT4" href="Formatting-Commands.html#DOCF4">(4)</a></h3>
<p>The word
<em>argument</em> comes from the way it is used in mathematics and does not
refer to a dispute between two people; it refers to the information
presented to the command.  According to the <cite>Oxford English
Dictionary</cite>, the word derives from the Latin for <em>to make clear,
prove</em>; thus it came to mean &lsquo;the evidence offered as proof&rsquo;, which is
to say, &lsquo;the information offered&rsquo;, which led to its mathematical
meaning.  In its other thread of derivation, the word came to mean &lsquo;to
assert in a manner against which others may make counter assertions&rsquo;,
which led to the meaning of &lsquo;argument&rsquo; as a dispute.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT5" href="titlepage.html#DOCF5">(5)</a></h3>
<p>We have found
that it is helpful to refer to versions of independent manuals as
&lsquo;editions&rsquo; and versions of programs as &lsquo;versions&rsquo;; otherwise, we find we
are liable to confuse each other in conversation by referring to both
the documentation and the software with the same words.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT6" href="Menus.html#DOCF6">(6)</a></h3>
<p>Menus can
carry you to any node, regardless of the hierarchical structure; even to
nodes in a different Info file.  However, the GNU Emacs Texinfo mode
updating commands work only to create menus of subordinate nodes.
Conventionally, cross references are used to refer to other nodes.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT7" href="lisp.html#DOCF7">(7)</a></h3>
<p>It would be straightforward to extend Texinfo to work
in a similar fashion for C, Fortran, or other languages.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT8" href="Footnotes.html#DOCF8">(8)</a></h3>
<p>A footnote should complement or expand upon
the primary text, but a reader should not need to read a footnote to
understand the primary text.  For a thorough discussion of footnotes,
see <cite>The Chicago Manual of Style</cite>, which is published by the
University of Chicago Press.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT9" href="Footnote-Commands.html#DOCF9">(9)</a></h3>
<p>Here
is the sample footnote.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT10" href="Preparing-for-TeX.html#DOCF10">(10)</a></h3>
<p>Note the use
of the &lsquo;<samp>;</samp>&rsquo; character, instead of &lsquo;<samp>:</samp>&rsquo;, as directory separator
on these systems.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT11" href="New-Info-File.html#DOCF11">(11)</a></h3>
<p>On MS-DOS/MS-Windows systems, Info will
try the &lsquo;<tt>.inf</tt>&rsquo; extension as well.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT12" href="Other-Info-Directories.html#DOCF12">(12)</a></h3>
<p>Note the
use of &lsquo;<samp>;</samp>&rsquo; as the directory separator, and a different syntax for
using values of other environment variables.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT13" href="Other-Info-Directories.html#DOCF13">(13)</a></h3>
<p>On MS-DOS/MS-Windows systems, use semi-colon instead.
</p><h3><a name="FOOT14" href="Refilling-Paragraphs.html#DOCF14">(14)</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps the command should have been
called the <code>@refillandindent</code> command, but <code>@refill</code> is
shorter and the name was chosen before indenting was possible.
