Texinfo::Parser (tp) is a Perl module for parsing Texinfo code into a 
tree representing the Texinfo code structure.

These other modules and libraries are required.  All have been standard
parts of Perl for years.
  Carp, Config, Data::Dumper, Encode, File::Basename, File::Spec
  Getopt::Long, Unicode::Normalize

It also uses the less widely-available modules:
  Locale::Messages, Unicode::EastAsianWidth, Text::Unidecode.
For these, internal versions are included, and are installed and used as
part of Texinfo (not disturbing the Perl installation at all).

To run the tests you also need:
  Data::Compare, Test::Deep, Clone.
On Debian-based distros, the corresponding packages are:
libdata-compare-perl libtest-deep-perl libclone-perl
