This README.dev file describes the development environment.

The development sources for GNU Texinfo are available through anonymous
CVS at Savannah:
  http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=texinfo

This distribution uses whatever versions of Automake, Autoconf, and
Gettext are listed in NEWS; usually the latest ones released.  If you
are getting the sources from CVS (or change configure.ac), you'll need
to have these tools installed to (re)build.  You'll also need help2man.
All of these programs are available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu.

After getting the CVS sources, and installing the tools above, you can run
  ./autogen.sh
to do a fresh build.  After that first time, running make should suffice.

This distribution also uses Gnulib (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib)
to share common files, with the files being checked in to CVS.  If you
get automake/conf/etc. errors from ./autogen.sh, please try doing a CVS
checkout of gnulib (in a separate directory to the texinfo checkout),
and then run
  ../gnulib/gnulib-tool --update
in your top-level Texinfo directory.  (gnulib-tool is in the gnulib CVS tree.)

For the record, the first time invocation was
  gnulib-tool --import --m4-base=gnulib/m4 --source-base=gnulib/lib getopt
The currently-used gnulib modules and other gnulib information are
recorded in gnulib/m4/gnulib-cache.m4.  Given a source checkout of
gnulib, you can update the files with gnulib-tool --import.
