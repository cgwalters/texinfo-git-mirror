The development sources for GNU Texinfo are available through anonymous
CVS at Savannah:
  http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=texinfo

This distribution uses whatever versions of Automake, Autoconf, and
Gettext are listed in NEWS; usually the latest ones released.  If you
are getting the sources from CVS (or change configure.ac), you'll need
to have these tools installed to (re)build.  You'll also need help2man.
All of these programs are available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu.

After getting the CVS sources, and installing the tools above, you can run
 ./autogen.sh
and then
 ./configure CFLAGS='-g -Wdeclaration-after-statement'
and then
 make

After the initial autogen && configure, simply running make should suffice.

The reason for that particular -W is that intermixing declarations with
statements is an easy thing to do accidentally, gcc won't warn about it
by default, and other compilers that don't support it are still
widespread.  Other -W options can be useful too, and patches are welcome
to resolve the diagnostics.  If you're not using gcc, of course you
shouldn't include it at all.

This distribution also uses Gnulib (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib)
to share common files, with the files being checked in to CVS.  If you
get automake/conf/etc. errors from ./autogen.sh, please try doing a CVS
checkout of gnulib (in a separate directory from the texinfo checkout),
and then run
  ../gnulib/gnulib-tool --add-import
in your top-level Texinfo directory.  (gnulib-tool is in the gnulib CVS tree.)

The currently-used gnulib modules and other gnulib information are
recorded in gnulib/m4/gnulib-cache.m4.  Given a source checkout of
gnulib, you can update the files with gnulib-tool --add-import.
